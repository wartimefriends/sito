# Cultural Association Wartime Friends

All those who want to support us can do so by becoming members. The material collected in recent years (books, videos, photos, war diaries, military maps, etc.) will be made available to members who request it, to give them the opportunity to expand their knowledge on a very important historical period  of our country, giving priority to the "minor" aspects of the presence of allied troops on the Senio front during the Second World War and the interaction with the population.
