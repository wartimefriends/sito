The autumn work of 2006 led to the creation of a series of 15 panels, with which an exhibition entitled In Sunny Italy was set up **[In Sunny Italy][sunny]**

**Inauguration December 2006 ** - The first performance took place from December 16th 2006 in the  **[Church of the Suffragio ][bagnacavallo]** in Bagnacavallo (click on link to see some videos). 

In **spring 2007**, the exhibition moved to Lugo, first in the premises of the Liceo Trisi, then, between April and May, in those of the Biblioteca Trisi. 

On **May 5, 2007**, live on television, from the studios of Canale 11 in Imola, some members of the research group were able to illustrate the details of the activities carried out by the University of Adults in Lugo, focusing on the traveling exhibition. 

From **May 18, 2007** it has been possible to view it in Villanova as part of the celebrations in honor of Canadian veterans visiting our province.

But it is in **November 2007**  that the Itinerant Exhibition, taking advantage of the bi-linguistic nature of the texts of the panels, crosses the national borders to arrive in the United Kingdom, more precisely in the cities of Stone and Stafford.

After returning to Italy, **in 2009** the panels were used for an exhibition in the city of Cervia.

Below an interview at the Canale 11 studios presenting the exhibition and the research work we carried out.
