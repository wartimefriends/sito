<img src="/images/files/Amici_di_guerra_DVD_r.jpg" title="Amici di Guerra in DVD">  The story of the passage of allied troops in our areas through images of the time. Images showing the harshness of military life, but also how the soldiers, by interacting with the local population, managed to find, for short periods, the "normality" and the "taste of home". John Thurlby and Alan Woods lived this experience firsthand, and their vivid memories, after more than 60 years, make it clear how important it was to find a home away from home.<br><i>Available in Italian.</i></TD>

Sixty years later, we retrace the stages of the advance of the Canadian Perth Regiment in the area between the Lamone and Senio rivers, guided by the descriptions of Stan Scislowsky in "Not All of Us Were Brave". We start from Villanova di Bagnacavallo by bicycle and take photographs of the streets, fields, farms and other buildings according to the order remembered precisely by Stan. The beautiful spring day and the tranquility of the countryside are very different from the scenario in which the Perth moved, but we are still able to trace some signs of the war in the old farmhouses, in the fields that we imagine crossed by the soldiers and in the narrow canals, up at the Senio embankment, where our bike ride ends near the war memorial.
<br><i>Bilingual Italian / English version.</i>
