This cemetery was established by the 5th Canadian Armoured Division, which succeeded in establishing a bridgehead over the River Lamone here during the night 10-11 December 1944.
West of this bridgehead there was heavy fighting when attempts were made to cross the three canals that run from Faenza to the sea. Many of those who died are buried in the cemetery, while others died in the advance to the final line held by the Canadians on the River Senio before they left Italy in February 1945.
