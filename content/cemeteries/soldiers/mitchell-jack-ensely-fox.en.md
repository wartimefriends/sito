<br>


Private Jack Ensely Fox MITCHELL, a soldier of the Westminster Regiment (Motors) of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, embodied dedication and bravery in the face of war.
Born on October 19, 1922, in Toronto, Ontario, Jack grew up in a family that understood hardship and resilience. The youngest of four children, he was raised by his father, George Ensley, after his mother, Margaret Craig Bain, passed away when he was still young. His siblings, William, Frank, and Mary Isobel, were his steadfast companions. His brother Frank was also serving overseas with the Queen’s Own Rifles, inspiring Jack to follow in his footsteps.

Jack’s early life was marked by a blend of hard work and ambition. After finishing eighth grade and completing a year at technical high school, he ventured into various trades, gaining skills and experience along the way. He worked as a printer’s apprentice, earning $13 a week at Livingstone Press in Toronto, and later as a plater’s helper at Hees Window Blinds, where he earned $18 weekly. Jack also spent time in mixed farming and as a machine operator in the hardwood flooring industry, roles that kept him close to his roots and instilled in him a strong work ethic. He enjoyed hobbies like reading fiction and was known for his quiet, pleasant demeanor, which endeared him to his colleagues and family alike. In his free time, he loved roller-skating, fishing, swimming, and baseball—showing his affinity for both the indoors and outdoors.

On October 26, 1942, Jack enlisted in Toronto. His initial training took him across Canada, and by March 1943, he was posted to the United Kingdom, beginning his overseas service. Like many soldiers, Jack’s reasons for enlisting were deeply personal: he wanted to join his brother, Frank, who was serving overseas, and to contribute his skills and strength to the cause.

Jack’s journey led him to Italy in May 1944, where he was assigned to the Westminster Regiment. Italy’s rugged terrain and grueling conditions tested even the most seasoned soldiers, but Jack’s quiet resilience and cooperative nature carried him through. He was known as a reliable member of the regiment, his calm under pressure and dedication to his comrades unwavering.

The Westminster Regiment’s war diaries record that December 15, 1944, dawned bright after a foggy night. Spirits were high that morning, as both Brigadier Lind and Major-General Hoffmeister praised the regiment for their recent successes, which had made a crucial difference to the Army’s overall plan. The regiment was in the thick of action, and the headquarters were bustling with communication. Around midday, the regiment’s commanding officer and his intelligence officer set out to visit A Company, accompanied by Lance Corporal W. Armour. En route, they were forced to pause as enemy shelling rained down, taking cover in a nearby ditch filled with water. Although they escaped without harm, the sounds of enemy fire lingered—a reminder of the constant danger.

The afternoon’s events were less fortunate for Jack. As the bombardment continued, enemy self-propelled guns zeroed in on their position, and the motor company suffered two casualties: Private Jack Ensely Fox Mitchell and Private J.K. McAbee. 
Jack, at only 22 years old, was killed in action that day, his life cut short amidst the smoke and shellfire of the Italian front.

Private Jack Mitchell now rests in Villanova War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot VII, Row B, Grave 9. His sacrifice left an indelible mark on his family and regiment, who remembered him as a quiet, steady presence, committed to his duty and the ideals he held dear. 
His legacy endures, a reminder of the courage shown by so many who gave everything in service to their country.
