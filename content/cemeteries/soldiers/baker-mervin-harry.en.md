<br>


Mervin Harry Baker was born on June 25, 1919, in Nanton, Alberta, to William and Pearl Ruby Baker. His childhood was marked by tragedy: he lost his father when he was only 14 months old. Despite this loss, Mervin grew up in a close-knit family with his older brother, Delbert, and sister, Pearl. His upbringing on the family farm in southern Alberta taught him the value of hard work and deeply connected him to rural life.

Mervin attended school in Nanton, completing the ninth grade before leaving to help support his family. He worked on the family farm and later took on agricultural jobs, becoming skilled at handling horse teams. By age 17, Mervin was driving trucks for J. Amer in High River, earning $17.50 a week. His skills expanded to include tractor and vehicle repairs, which he performed independently. In the two years leading up to his enlistment, Mervin drove fuel trucks for the #5 Elementary Flying Training School in High River.

Standing 1.73 meters tall and weighing 81.5 kilograms, Mervin had a sturdy build, blue eyes, and brown hair. Known for his calm and confident demeanor, he was in good health despite a slightly weaker right eye. His hobbies included skating, fishing, hunting, and playing sports—he played hockey as a forward and excelled as a pitcher in baseball. He also enjoyed reading western novels, reflecting his practical and grounded nature.

On August 19, 1939, Mervin married Viola Myrtle in Calgary, Alberta, and the couple soon welcomed a daughter, Myra Myrtle. A devoted husband and father, Mervin worked tirelessly to provide for his family. He dreamed of returning to farming or pursuing a career as an automotive mechanic after the war.

As World War II intensified, Mervin felt compelled to serve. On February 15, 1943, at the age of 23, he enlisted in the Canadian Army in Calgary, Alberta. His motivation for enlisting was straightforward: he believed he would be called up eventually and wanted to take responsibility for his service. Assigned to the infantry, Mervin underwent training that prepared him to be a capable driver or gunner, despite his initial hesitation about active service.

Mervin’s instructors noted his intelligence, stability, and reliability. On September 26, 1944, he was transferred to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, a regiment renowned for its bravery and resilience. He was sent to the United Kingdom in December 1943 and arrived in Italy in February 1944, joining the grueling Italian Campaign.

The Italian Campaign was one of the most challenging theaters of the war. Soldiers faced fierce enemy resistance, treacherous terrain, and harsh weather conditions. Despite these difficulties, Mervin served with dedication, fighting alongside his regiment as they advanced northward through Italy.

On December 13, 1944, Mervin’s unit was engaged in combat near the Fosso Munio, a strategically vital area heavily defended by German forces. During the battle, Mervin was reported missing in action. For weeks, his family held out hope that he had survived, but on January 10, 1945, they received the devastating news that Mervin had been killed in action.
He was 25 years old.

Mervin’s death was a profound loss for his family. His widow, Viola, and their four-year-old daughter, Myra, faced life without the husband and father who had given so much for his country. Viola later received a photograph of Mervin’s grave at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he was laid to rest in Plot I, Row B, Grave 7.

The rest of Mervin’s family also felt the enduring impact of his sacrifice. His mother, Pearl Ruby Baker, remained in High River, Alberta, while his brother Delbert and sister Pearl carried on with their lives, deeply affected by the loss of their younger brother.

Mervin’s memory was honored not only by his family but also by the communities of Nanton and High River, where he had lived and worked for much of his life.

The story of Private Mervin Harry Baker is a testament to resilience, duty, and sacrifice. From his humble beginnings on a farm in southern Alberta to the battlefields of Italy, Mervin demonstrated unwavering commitment to his family, community, and country. His dreams of returning to farming or becoming a mechanic were tragically cut short, but his courage and dedication remain a lasting tribute to the bravery of a generation that gave everything for the better future we enjoy today.

Mervin’s life and service remind us of the profound cost of war and the eternal gratitude owed to those who made the ultimate sacrifice. His name, etched in stone at the Villanova War Cemetery, is a lasting tribute to a young man who gave everything for freedom and peace.
