Although he didn’t enjoy school and only completed a grade education, he found purpose in his work as a farm laborer for six years.
At 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 150 pounds, Ray had a fair complexion, blue eyes, and blonde hair. 
As a Roman Catholic and a single man, he felt a strong sense of duty to serve his country, which led him to enlist in the military on August 8, 1940, in Brantford, Ontario. Ray chose to enlist in the Dufferin and Haldeman Rifles to avoid conscription.
His military career began in Canada, where he served until May 12, 1943. On May 13, 1943, he was transferred to the Irish Regiment of Canada in the United Kingdom. During his time in the UK, Ray continued his training and prepared for active combat. He served in Italy from October 24, 1943, until his tragic death on December 13, 1944, during the regiment's fight to cross the Fosso Vecchio at Villa Prati, Bagnacavallo.
Ray was known for his quiet demeanor and articulate nature. Interviewers noted his sincerity, exceptional physique, and ability to handle strain. He enjoyed swimming, hunting, fishing, wrestling, and sports such as baseball, soccer, and volleyball. In addition to his athletic pursuits, he had an interest in shows, dances, and learning to electric weld.
Ray Schmidt was killed in action at the age of 25, a brave soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. 
He was laid to rest at the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot VII, Row A, Grave 6, where his memory is honored alongside his fellow soldiers who fought for freedom and peace.
