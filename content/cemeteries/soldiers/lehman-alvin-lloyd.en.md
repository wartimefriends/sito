+++


Alvin Lloyd Lehman was born on May 1, 1923, in Stouffville, Ontario, the second son of Wesley Albert and Arvilla Laurena Lehman. Raised in a loving family with his two brothers, John Wesley and Bruce Stanley, Alvin grew up in a supportive environment that instilled in him a strong sense of responsibility and commitment. His elder brother, John Wesley, also served in the military with the 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Alvin’s life was shaped by his faith as a member of the United Church and his love for outdoor activities like skating, swimming, and hunting. He also excelled in high school sports, playing defense in hockey and infield in baseball.

Standing at 5’10” and weighing 166 pounds, Alvin had a medium complexion, brown eyes, and brown hair. His quiet, reserved nature belied a sharp intellect and a learning ability that surpassed the army average. Described as shy but stable, he brought a calm determination to every task. 
Alvin completed Grade 10 and entered the workforce, gaining valuable experience as a truck driver, munitions worker, and motor mechanic before being called up for military service.

Alvin enlisted in the Canadian Army on November 14, 1942, in Toronto, Ontario, joining the Number 2 District Depot General List. After completing his initial training in Canada, he departed for the United Kingdom on August 29, 1943.
There, he underwent further preparation for the challenges ahead before being deployed to Italy on March 27, 1944. On August 2, 1944, Alvin joined the Irish Regiment of Canada in Italy, becoming part of “C” Company. 
His hard work and dedication were recognized when he was promoted to Lance Corporal on October 12, 1944.

The Italian Campaign was grueling, characterized by harsh terrain and relentless combat. Alvin served bravely, demonstrating both skill and fortitude in the face of adversity. His company often found itself under heavy fire, especially during the intense fighting in the final months of 1944. Despite these challenges, Alvin remained steadfast, embodying the quiet strength and resilience for which he was known.

Tragically, Alvin’s life was cut short on January 2, 1945, during heavy artillery fire in the area of Mezzano, Northern Italy, as part of the action near San Alberto. He was just 21 years old. 
His loss deeply impacted his family, particularly his mother, who treasured the Memorial Cross awarded to her but later had it stolen in 1950.

Alvin Lloyd Lehman was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot II, Row A, Grave 1. His sacrifice is honored alongside his comrades, a testament to the courage and dedication of those who fought in the name of freedom.

Lance Corporal Lehman’s quiet determination, unwavering service, and ultimate sacrifice serve as a poignant reminder of the bravery and humanity of those who answered the call of duty. 
His memory lives on in the hearts of his family, his community, and his country.
