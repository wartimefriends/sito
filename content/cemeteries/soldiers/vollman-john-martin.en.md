Corporal John Martin VOLLMAN was born on December 20, 1920, in Balgonie, Saskatchewan. He grew up in a challenging environment; his father, Philip, passed away when John was only eight years old, and his mother, Nellie, remarried to Maxwell Matt. Although from a broken home, John maintained a close connection with his mother, naming her as his next of kin instead of his stepfather. He was the second eldest among his siblings, which included three brothers—Martin, George, and Henry—and three sisters—Monica, Katie, and Amelia.

John attended school until Grade 6 before entering the workforce as a farm laborer, primarily working in grain farming. He was highly skilled in this trade, working in Alberta and Saskatchewan, earning $20 per week with board included. Despite the hardship of his upbringing, he enjoyed outdoor activities such as skating, swimming, hunting, fishing, horseback riding, and playing sports like softball and basketball. His fluency in both English and German added to his versatility.

Motivated by a sense of adventure, John enlisted in the Canadian Army on February 25, 1942, in Regina, Saskatchewan. He underwent basic training at the 120 Basic Training Centre in Regina and later advanced training at the A4 Canadian Armoured Training Centre in Brandon, Manitoba. Initially slow to pick up military skills, John persevered, eventually passing as a third-class gunner and showing his cheerful and stable personality throughout his training.

John was sent overseas to the United Kingdom on July 22, 1942, and was assigned to the Royal Canadian Artillery’s Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) units. He served in the UK for over a year before being deployed to the Italian front in October 1943. He proved to be a capable soldier, eventually being promoted to Lance Corporal in September 1944.

In October 1944, John’s unit was redesignated to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, part of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, reflecting the increasing need for infantry forces in the final stages of the Italian Campaign. Unfortunately, John’s service came to a tragic end on December 19, 1944, just one day before his 24th birthday, when he was killed in action during the fierce battles in Italy. He was laid to rest at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot I, Row A, Grave 1.

John Martin Vollman’s legacy is one of dedication, resilience, and service, standing out as a man who overcame personal challenges to fight bravely for his country. His contribution to the war effort, and the ultimate sacrifice he made, are remembered with deep respect.
