Donald Maurice Foster was born on June 8, 1923, in Toronto, Ontario, to Cecil William and Ethel Pearl Foster. One of eight siblings, he grew up in a lively household with two brothers—Douglas Haig and Robert John—and five sisters: Cleo Patricia Bain, Georgia Cecilia Gray, Dorothy Bernice, Mary Elizabeth Joan, and Joyce Marylan Louise. As the fourth child in the family, Donald’s upbringing was shaped by a sense of duty and responsibility.

Donald attended an urban school in Toronto, completing Grade 10 before leaving to pursue work opportunities. He participated in sports such as baseball and basketball during his school years, showcasing his athleticism. Fond of music, he played the guitar and was an active member of the Y.M.C.A. and a recreational club at work.

With aspirations to become a machinist, Donald took evening courses in bookkeeping, typing, and machine shop practice at Western Technical School in Toronto. His training and subsequent employment at Hamilton Gear and Machine Co. as a turret lathe operator prepared him for wartime manufacturing. However, his strong sense of duty led him to enlist in the Canadian Army on April 15, 1943, in Toronto.

At 5’9” tall and weighing 142 pounds, Donald was a well-groomed and fit recruit with a pleasant demeanor. Despite challenges such as a stammer and poor vision in one eye, he demonstrated above-average learning ability and a willingness to serve. Initially interested in trade training with the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (R.C.O.C.) or Royal Navy, he accepted his assignment to infantry training and adapted well to military life. His dedication and progress were noted by his superiors, who described him as a capable recruit with potential to become an excellent soldier.

Donald completed his training at Camp Borden and Aldershot, Nova Scotia, before being deployed overseas. He arrived in the United Kingdom on September 19, 1943, and later joined the Italian Campaign, disembarking in Italy on January 24, 1944. As part of the Allied forces, he participated in the arduous campaign to liberate Italy, enduring harsh conditions and relentless combat.

On May 16, 1944, Donald sustained superficial shrapnel wounds to both thighs but returned to service after recovering. 
By October 1944, he was reassigned to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, continuing to serve on the front lines. On December 14, 1944, during operations in Italy, Donald was critically wounded again. Despite medical efforts, he succumbed to his injuries the following day, on December 15, 1944, at the age of 21.

Private Donald Maurice Foster was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, where his grave serves as a tribute to his courage and sacrifice. 
His life, shaped by resilience and a desire to serve, reflects the spirit of a generation dedicated to the cause of freedom.

From his roots in Toronto to his service in the Italian Campaign, Donald’s journey is a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by so many young Canadians during the Second World War. 
Though his life was tragically brief, his memory endures in the hearts of his family and the annals of history, honoring his contribution to the fight for peace and liberty.
