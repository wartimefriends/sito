<br>


Ralph James OLDIS was born on April 12, 1918, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The only child of Fred and Rita Oldis, Ralph grew up in a family that faced the challenges of separation, with his parents parting ways during his youth. His father worked as an auto-painter in Vancouver, a trade that would later influence Ralph’s own career path, while his mother relocated to Calgary, becoming Mrs. J. Dunn.

Ralph attended school up to the eighth grade, leaving at the age of 16. Despite the early conclusion of his formal education, he was noted for his normal conduct during his school years. An active and outdoorsy young man, he enjoyed swimming, golf, and hunting—activities that highlighted his adventurous spirit and physical capabilities.

Embarking on his working life, Ralph became a baker’s apprentice at Bennett’s Bakery in Vancouver from 1934 to 1937, completing his course and earning a weekly wage of $18. Seeking new experiences, he then worked in the logging industry from 1937 to 1938 with Wood & English Co. in Inglewood on Vancouver Island, where he earned $35 per week. His adaptability and willingness to learn led him to his next role as an auto painter at Vancouver Motors from 1938 to 1940, earning $22.50 per week—a profession that mirrored his father’s.

Standing at 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing 160 pounds, Ralph was known for his neat appearance and cheerful disposition. His brown eyes reflected a determined and optimistic outlook on life. Although he expressed a desire to become a welder, the unfolding global events would chart a different course for him.

On August 5, 1940, at the age of 22, Ralph enlisted in the Canadian Army in Vancouver, joining the 5th Canadian Motorcycle Regiment. His decision to enlist was fueled by the sense of duty that many young Canadians felt during this tumultuous time, though specific reasons were not officially recorded. Initially stationed in Vernon, British Columbia, his regiment moved to Victoria-Esquimalt in October 1940 and then to Camp Borden, Ontario, in May 1941.

Ralph’s early military career saw a few minor disciplinary issues related to being absent without leave (AWOL). However, these infractions ceased once he was deployed overseas. Embarking from Halifax on November 10, 1941, he arrived in Liverpool, England, on November 24. In the United Kingdom, he continued his service with his unit, which had been re-designated as the 9th Armoured Regiment (British Columbia Dragoons) of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps.

Demonstrating mechanical aptitude, Ralph qualified as a driver mechanic for tracked vehicles—a critical role in armoured warfare. His skills were further recognized when he qualified as a Driver Mechanic M.T. (Motor Transport). On November 14, 1943, he embarked from the UK to join the Italian Campaign, an essential part of the Allied effort to liberate Europe from Axis forces.

Serving in Italy from November 15, 1943, Ralph was an integral part of his regiment’s operations. On November 25, 1944, he was taken back on strength with the 9th Armoured Regiment after a period away. 
Tragically, just a week later, he was reported missing, believed to have been killed while driving an echelon tank—a vital role responsible for logistical support and maintaining supply lines to the front.

Official confirmation of his death came on January 13, 1945. Trooper Ralph James Oldis was killed in action on January 1, 1945, at the age of 24. His sacrifice is commemorated at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot II, Row A, Grave 6. His service and ultimate sacrifice stand as a solemn reminder of the young lives lost during the pursuit of peace and freedom.

Remembered for his cheerful nature and dedication to duty, Trooper Oldis embodied the courage and resilience of countless Canadians who served in World War II. His journey from a young tradesman in Vancouver to a soldier on the battlefields of Italy reflects the profound contributions and sacrifices made by individuals during one of history’s most challenging periods. His legacy endures as a testament to the bravery and selflessness of those who gave their lives in the fight against tyranny.

From Mark Zuehlke:
Writing today about the 5th Division assault to pinch out the salient south of the Senio River between Alfonsine and the Adriatic coast. On January 1, C and A Squadrons of the BC Dragoons were forming up in the town of Mezzano, about three miles southeast of German-occupied Alfonsine. Suddenly a squadron of USAAF Thunderbolts swooped down to bomb and strafe the tankers in Mezzano--having mistaken the town for Alfonsine. C Squadron Trooper Ralph James Oldis was killed, one other tanker was wounded, and six civilians were either killed or wounded. Trooper Oldis was 24 and is buried in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery. I have not been able to find a photo of either Trooper Oldis or his headstone, but will make a point of visiting his grave at Villanova when our Liberation Tours Spring 2019 Italian Campaign Pilgrimage visits the cemetery.
