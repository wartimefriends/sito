Trooper Clifford Harold Craig was born on October 3, 1920, in Toronto, Ontario, into a modest but loving family. The eldest of three children, Clifford grew up with his younger brother, Frederick Cecil, and his sister, Francis Matilda. His father, James, was a carpenter who suffered from a physical disability, and Clifford became the sole support of his family after his father’s passing in July 1942.

Clifford’s childhood was marked by responsibility and resilience. Leaving school at 13 to support his family, he worked irregular jobs to make ends meet. Despite his limited formal education, he developed a passion for mechanics and engines, excelling in hands-on tasks. Clifford’s hobbies included hunting, swimming, skating, and softball, where he played first base. A man of many talents, he could play the guitar, mouth organ, and sing.

Before enlisting, Clifford held various jobs, including motorcycle and taxi driving, delivery work, and farming. He earned $18 per week as a driver and $14 per week in printing and electrical appliance work. Despite his challenging circumstances, Clifford was cheerful, full of life, and determined to build a future for himself, dreaming of owning his own farm after the war.

Standing 5’8” tall and weighing 147.5 pounds, Clifford was described as healthy, well-built, and neat in appearance. With blue eyes, fair hair, and a fair complexion, he carried himself with confidence and energy. 
Though he initially struggled with the Army’s strict discipline, he quickly settled into military life, channeling his love for mechanics and motorcycling into his service.

On June 25, 1941, Clifford enlisted in the Canadian Army in Toronto, motivated by a desire to volunteer rather than be conscripted. He began his training in Canada before being deployed to the United Kingdom in April 1942. 
In November 1943, he joined the Italian Campaign, a grueling theater of the Second World War that demanded courage, resilience, and skill.

By November 1944, Clifford was assigned to the Governor General’s Horse Guards (GGHG), an armoured reconnaissance regiment. His expertise with engines and motorcycling made him a valuable asset to his unit. 
Clifford was wounded on November 13, 1944, but he returned to duty, demonstrating his determination to serve despite the risks.

Tragically, on December 25, 1944, Clifford succumbed to wounds sustained in action near Villanova, Italy. He was 25 years old.

From the War Diary of the GGHG regiment:
25 Dec.
…
“Christmas morning was not entirely without incident, however, as an 'A' Squadron jeep ran over a mine on the Via Naviglio, near its junction with Medicine, and the driver, Tpr. Craig, was evacuated. Engineers set to work to make a second inspection of the road, but it proved to have been an isolated mine missed by the clearing party.”

Trooper Clifford Harold Craig was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot V, Row C, Grave 4. His grave is a poignant reminder of a young man’s ultimate sacrifice for freedom.

Clifford’s story is one of resilience, energy, and dedication. From his modest beginnings in Toronto to the battlefields of Italy, he embodied the spirit of service and sacrifice that defined his generation. 
Though his life was cut short, his memory endures in the hearts of his family and the history of the Governor General’s Horse Guards.

Trooper Clifford Harold Craig’s sacrifice reminds us of the immense cost of war and the enduring legacy of those who gave their all for a better future. 
His life serves as a tribute to the ordinary individuals who rose to extraordinary challenges in the pursuit of freedom and peace.
