<br>


Delmer Douglas SANDERSON was born on January 10, 1925, in Reedy Creek, Manitoba, where he spent a modest, rural upbringing on his family’s small farm. Raised in a close-knit, happy family, Delmer was the youngest of four children born to William James Gilbert and Margaret Sanderson. His brother, Thomas, served in the Queen’s Own Cameron Highlanders, and his sisters, Gladys and Edna, later married and settled down in Manitoba.

Delmer’s early years were spent helping his father with the chores on their ten-acre farm, where he fed cattle, took care of the pigs, and often drove the horses. Standing at 6 feet and just under an inch tall, with a slender frame and brown eyes, he wore glasses due to nearsightedness, which made reading difficult. He completed grade seven by the age of 15, though school had never truly captivated him. Instead, he found fulfillment in farm work, where he could put his steady, reliable nature to practical use. Outside of work, Delmer enjoyed softball and skating, and he found solace in attending church regularly and occasionally going to dances.

On August 31, 1943, Delmer enlisted in the Canadian Army in Winnipeg, Manitoba, at the age of 18. Although his precise reasons for enlisting aren’t recorded, his decision likely carried a mixture of duty and a desire to follow in his brother’s footsteps. Initially assigned to the Canadian Infantry Corps, he later joined the Perth Regiment before moving to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, a reconnaissance unit within the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. Known by his superiors as a “gangly country youth,” Delmer’s shy demeanor and earnest speech gave him an air of seriousness beyond his years. Though unpolished, he was described as reliable and steady—a young man who would do his best regardless of the challenge.

Private Sanderson’s military journey took him first through basic training in Canada, from August 1943 until early April 1944. He was then sent overseas to the United Kingdom, where he spent only a few weeks before being deployed to the front lines in Italy on May 4, 1944. His time in Italy was challenging; on September 23, 1944, he was wounded, though he recovered and returned to active duty with his regiment.

On December 16, 1944, while serving with the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards in Italy, Private Delmer Sanderson was killed in action. He was just 21 years old. Delmer’s final resting place is in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he lies in Plot V, Row B, Grave 3.

Though his life was brief, Delmer Sanderson’s story reflects the quiet strength and resilience of a young man from rural Canada who stepped forward when called upon. His dedication to his family, his modest aspirations, and his courage in battle remain a testament to his character. Today, he is remembered for the sacrifice he made far from his home in Reedy Creek, Manitoba, serving with steadfast resolve until the very end.
