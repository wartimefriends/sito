Glen Howard Gile was born on March 26, 1922, in Palmerston, Ontario, to John and Olive Gile. One of seven siblings, Glen grew up alongside his brothers Gerald Ray and John Leslie, and his sisters Beulah Beatrice, Fern Boyne, Ivy Donalda, and Shirley Beth. Raised in rural Ontario, he had a normal childhood, contributing to the family farm and developing skills that would shape his future.

Glen attended school until the age of 14, leaving after Grade 8 to begin working. He found employment on various farms in Huron County, engaging in mixed farming from 1938 to 1942. At the time of his enlistment, Glen stood 5’8” tall, weighed 145 pounds, and had brown eyes. He was described as agreeable, well-mannered, and physically fit, with a good disposition and mechanical aptitude. These qualities made him a strong candidate for military service.

On June 29, 1942, Glen enlisted in the Canadian Army in London, Ontario, motivated by a desire to “do his part.” Initially assigned to the artillery, Glen received advanced training with the Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment before being deployed overseas. He arrived in the United Kingdom in September 1943 and joined the Italian Campaign in February 1944. His journey then took him to Southern France in August 1944, where he served with the First Special Service Force, also known as the “Devil’s Brigade.” Returning to Italy in December 1944, Glen was reassigned to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, which had been redesignated as infantry after arriving in Sicily the previous year.

The regiment was heavily involved in critical operations across Italy, including battles at the Rubicone, the Savio River, and the Naviglio Canal. In early January 1945, the regiment was positioned near Fusignano, Italy, defending key areas against persistent German attacks.

On the night of January 5-6, 1945, Glen’s unit faced intense enemy action. Two small patrols sent out earlier in the evening were forced to retreat after encountering heavy fire. At 2:50 a.m., “D” Company reported an attack on its right flank. Artillery and mortar fire were called in to counter the advancing enemy, but communication challenges arose when German forces intercepted telephone lines and attempted to misdirect Canadian artillery fire onto their own troops. Despite these difficulties, “D” Company managed to repel the attack through coordinated grenade and rifle fire, holding their ground.

Later in the day, Canadian artillery shelled enemy positions, including a suspected German outpost and a sniper-occupied house that caught fire. Amid the chaos, Glen Gile lost his life during the fierce combat that characterized the day’s events. He was 22 years old.

Private Glen Howard Gile was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy. His sacrifice is a reminder of the bravery and resilience of soldiers who endured relentless challenges in the fight for freedom.

From his early days as a farmhand in Huron County to his service in one of the most grueling theaters of the Second World War, Glen’s life exemplifies the courage and dedication of his generation. 
Though his life was tragically cut short, his memory endures in the hearts of his family and in the legacy of those who fought for peace.
