<br>


Born on June 11, 1921, in Storthoaks, Saskatchewan, Antoine grew up in a hardworking farming family. He was the fourth of nine children born to Alfred and Rose Bourget. His siblings included brothers Wilfred, who served overseas with the Canadian Army, Leopold, Armand, and Henri, as well as sisters Jeanne (Smith), Aurore (Belva), and Helene.

Antoine completed Grade 8 at the age of 16, repeating Grade 6 along the way. He was described as a quiet, nervous young man with average learning ability, fluent in both French and English, and particularly skilled in reading. Antoine enjoyed a variety of sports, including hockey, softball, baseball, swimming, and boxing. His hobbies reflected his active and social nature, even as his demeanor remained reserved.

Before enlisting, Antoine worked alongside his father on the family’s 1¼-section farm, gaining five years of experience in mixed farming. He also spent a year working in the war industries in Fort William, Ontario, where he completed training in acetylene and arc welding, machinist work, and sheet metal riveting through a Youth Training program in Regina. These experiences made him skilled in mechanics, with the ability to drive and repair cars and trucks. His practical expertise, combined with his strong work ethic, reflected the values instilled by his upbringing.

On December 19, 1942, Antoine enlisted in the Canadian Army in Regina, Saskatchewan, expressing a desire to see the world and contribute to the war effort. He initially trained in Canada before being deployed to the United Kingdom in July 1943 and subsequently to Italy in October of that year. While he was initially interested in joining the Royal Canadian Artillery, he was assigned to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, a reconnaissance regiment tasked with critical and dangerous missions on the front lines.

Antoine served with determination and courage throughout the Italian Campaign, a grueling theater of war known for its harsh terrain and fierce enemy resistance. Despite being described as a somewhat nervous and restless individual, he was eager to join a combat unit and proved himself a capable and dedicated soldier.

Tragically, on December 13, 1944, during operations near Villanova, Antoine was killed in action at the age of 23. 
The circumstances of his death are particularly poignant; his body, along with that of a comrade, was discovered by a soldier from the 60th Battery who recognized him as the brother of Gunner Wilfred Bourget. Antoine’s body was recovered and laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot III, Row C, Grave 9. His grave serves as a solemn reminder of his sacrifice.

Private Antoine Philip Bourget’s story is one of quiet dedication and service. From the fields of Saskatchewan to the battlefields of Italy, he embodied the resilience and commitment of his generation. His family remembers him as a small, quiet man who dreamed of returning to mixed farming after the war, reflecting his deep connection to his roots. Despite their efforts, the family has been unable to find a photograph of Antoine, leaving his memory preserved only through stories and the legacy of his service.

The discovery of Antoine’s body by a fellow soldier who knew his family underscores the profound personal connections that existed even amidst the vast and impersonal machinery of war. 
His sacrifice is remembered with honor, and his life stands as a testament to the courage and dedication of those who gave everything in the pursuit of peace and freedom.
