<br>


William Parker THOMPSON, regimental number B143697, served with the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps.
Born on March 8, 1924, in Hamilton, Ontario, William was just 19 years old when he was killed in action on December 13, 1944 at the Fosso Vecchio.
He is buried in the Villanova War Cemetery, Italy, in plot VI A 1, where his ultimate sacrifice is honored.

William came from a working-class family. His father, Parker, and his mother, Ada, both lived in Hamilton, Ontario, where he resided prior to his enlistment. He had a brother, Stanley, who was stationed at Camp Borden, and a sister, Marjorie Parsons, who lived in Dauphin, Manitoba. 
William left school at the age of 15 to enter the workforce, where he worked for nearly three years as a weaver and winder at the Hamilton Cotton Company. Following that, he worked as a trained laborer for nine months at C.I.L. 
Despite these early responsibilities, William had dreams of serving in the military, a goal that he pursued with determination.

William attempted to enlist in 1942, but before he could be sworn in, he was required to undergo a hernia operation, which delayed his entry into the army. Undeterred, William successfully enlisted on February 3, 1943, in Hamilton, Ontario, at the age of 18. His enlistment marked the beginning of a military career that would tragically be cut short just over a year later.

Standing 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighing 165 pounds, William was described as tall and well-built. He was in excellent health following his surgery and was eager to begin his training. William had a pleasant, clean appearance and was noted for his friendly, alert, and cooperative manner. Though he had never played on organized sports teams, he enjoyed playing rugby, baseball, and indulging in other hobbies such as swimming, fishing, and bowling. His leisure time was often spent dancing, going to movies, playing cards, or reading light fiction. William’s personality and drive suggested that he would be a reliable and steady individual, traits that shone through both in his work and his military training.

During his initial interview for the army, William expressed a strong desire to learn the driver-mechanic’s trade, and his above-average learning ability made him well-suited for such a role. His determination and interest in mechanics were noted by his superiors, and they believed he would progress well through the normal training process in the Canadian Armoured Corps. 
William completed his training and was qualified as a Gunner Operator on October 10, 1943, and was deemed suitable for overseas service in this role.

Private Thompson’s military service took him through several key theaters of World War II. After serving in Canada from February 3, 1943, to October 22, 1943, William was sent to the United Kingdom, where he served until November 14, 1943. He was then deployed to Italy, where he served from November 15, 1943, until his death on December 13, 1944. 

Private William Parker Thompson’s dedication to duty and his willingness to serve, despite personal challenges, stand as a testament to his character. Though his life was tragically brief, his courage and commitment to his country will forever be remembered at his final resting place in Italy.
