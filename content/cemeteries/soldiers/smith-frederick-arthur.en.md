+++


Frederick Arthur Smith was born on July 4, 1913, in Stratford, Ontario, into a large family that would shape much of his life. He was one of the many children of Henry Thomas and Elizabeth Sarah Smith, growing up with five brothers—George, Harry, Alfred, William, and Victor—and three sisters—Lizzie, Lulu, and Lily. Tragically, two of his siblings, Joyce and Bobby, passed away at a young age. The Smith family was deeply rooted in their community, adhering to the values of the Church of England.

Frederick’s early life was marked by responsibility and hard work. He attended Shakespeare School in Stratford, completing grade VII before leaving school at the age of 14 to help support his family. His work history reflects a determination to provide for those he loved, taking on a variety of jobs, including positions as a deliveryman, bowling alley pin boy, factory assembler, and upholsterer. Just before his enlistment, Frederick was employed as a meat packer at Swift Packing Co. in Stratford, listing his trade as a cook assistant.

Frederick married Aileen May in 1937, but their marriage faced difficulties when he joined the military. After his enlistment in the army, the couple’s relationship deteriorated, and they eventually divorced in March 1943. Frederick later found love again and married Lillian Mills. Together, they had two children: Elizabeth Anne and Frederick Edward John, the latter of whom was born in May 1944, just weeks before Frederick would embark on his journey overseas.

On June 17, 1940, Frederick Arthur Smith enlisted in the Canadian Army at the London, Ontario, recruiting center, joining the Perth Regiment. His service began with the 1st Battalion of The Perth Regiment, and he was later transferred to the No. 1 District Depot, where he served as an office runner and batman, eventually becoming responsible for a team of runners. During this time, Frederick’s role shifted to supporting the regiment in various logistical capacities, reflecting his adaptability and dedication to his duties.

In January 1944, Frederick began his basic training with the Canadian Army Medical Corps, followed by advanced training until May of that year. He then traveled to the United Kingdom on June 24, 1944, to join the frontlines. In September, he was remustered to the Canadian Infantry Corps, preparing for active combat. On November 3, 1944, he proceeded to Italy, where he would join his regiment in the heart of the conflict.

Frederick’s journey with the Perth Regiment reached a tragic end almost as soon as it began. He arrived at the regiment’s camp on December 18, 1944, but within just two days, on December 20, 1944, he was killed in action.
