Private Victor
Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment R.C.I.C.
VI C 7


Victor Balash was born on May 25, 1923, in Kalaz, Slovakia. His early life was shaped by the hope for a better future as his family emigrated to Canada in October 1933. Victor, his mother Bertha, his older sister Magdalena, and his younger brother Andrew reunited in Fort William, Ontario, with his father, Andrew, who had arrived in Canada six years earlier to establish a foundation for the family. 
Settling in the “Westfort” neighborhood of Fort William, Victor attended St. Martin’s Elementary School and became a member of St. Agnes Roman Catholic Church.

Victor’s formative years in Canada revealed a bright, jovial, and hardworking young man. He began school at the age of 10, having already completed three years of education in Slovakia, but left after the 8th grade to pursue his passion for mechanics. 
Victor’s fascination with cars and machines was evident early on, as he not only worked as an assistant mechanic at Dominion Motors and Art’s Service Garage but also became one of the few young men in his neighborhood to own a car. He was often seen cruising the streets with a charming smile and a group of friends, earning him a reputation as a popular and charismatic figure.

Before enlisting, Victor also worked at the Great Lakes Paper Mill, operating wetting machines. His work ethic and mechanical skills were well-regarded, and he expressed a desire to deepen his knowledge of diesel mechanics. 
His sister remembered him as a cheerful and reliable young man with a good sense of humor and a friendly nature, qualities that would later endear him to his comrades in the military.

Victor enlisted in the Canadian Army on January 12, 1943, in Fort William, Ontario. Initially joining the Perth Regiment and then TOS by the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, R.C.I.C., he was eager to serve and dreamed of becoming a tank gunner. His instructors noted his reliability, intelligence, and enthusiasm, describing him as a tidy, well-built young man with a bright and alert demeanor. Victor completed specialized training as a tank gunner in May 1943 and was recognized for his potential to excel in mechanics and gunnery.

Victor’s service took him overseas to the United Kingdom in June 1943. A year later, in June 1944, he arrived in Italy as part of the Allied campaign to push German forces northward. During his time in Italy, Victor continued to develop his mechanical expertise, even returning to the garage for a diesel mechanics course. He also began learning German, always seeking to expand his skills and knowledge.

In a letter home dated November 24, 1944, Victor shared snapshots of a brief respite in Riccione, where he had enjoyed a 48-hour pass. Yet, the letter also carried a somber note as he expressed his fear of returning to the front lines. His words reflected the heavy toll of war, even on a young man known for his cheerful and optimistic spirit.

On December 18, 1944, Victor was killed in action during heavy shelling at Villa Prati, northwest of Ravenna, Italy. He was only 21 years old. 
His death came during a critical phase of the Italian Campaign, as Allied forces faced fierce resistance in their efforts to secure key positions. 
Victor’s sacrifice was a profound loss to his family, his regiment, and the community that had watched him grow from a spirited boy to a dedicated soldier.

Victor Balash was laid to rest in the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in grave VI.C.7. 
His story is one of resilience, ambition, and a deep commitment to service. From his humble beginnings on a farm in Slovakia to his dreams of becoming a skilled mechanic and serving in the tank corps, Victor’s life was marked by a relentless drive to better himself and to contribute to something greater than himself.

Though his time was tragically short, Victor’s memory lives on through the stories shared by his family and the legacy he left behind as a brave and honorable soldier. 
His life reminds us of the countless young men who gave up their dreams and futures for the sake of freedom and peace.
