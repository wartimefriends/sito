+++


Sergeant Edward Prokaska of the Irish Regiment of Canada is remembered as a dedicated and capable soldier who served with courage and loyalty until his death in Italy on December 12, 1944, at the age of 23. 
Born on January 1, 1920, in Brandon, Manitoba, Edward was known for his fair complexion, blue eyes, and strong six-foot frame—a presence that matched his steadfast character and sense of duty.

Edward was the son of Alexander and Edna Prokaska and grew up in a large family with a brother, Peter, and four sisters, Ann, Lillian, May, and Edna. After two years of high school, he left school to work, finding employment as a waiter and handyman at the Crystal Hotel in Brandon. Despite his dissatisfaction with school, Edward proved to be a quick learner with a resilient disposition, qualities that later served him well in military service.

On June 21, 1940, Edward enlisted in Toronto, Ontario, feeling called to serve his country during one of the most challenging periods of World War II. 
He joined the Irish Regiment of Canada and embarked on a journey that would take him far from home. After two years of service in Canada, he was deployed to the United Kingdom in October 1942, and later, in October 1943, to Italy, where he would join his regiment in a number of crucial and intense battles. His leadership qualities quickly became evident; he was promoted to corporal in September 1943, to lance sergeant in May 1944, and finally to sergeant in December of the same year.

While stationed in the U.K., Edward expressed frustration at the lack of action, eager to join his comrades on the front lines. Described as a stable, hardworking non-commissioned officer, he excelled in his duties, earning the respect of those around him. His journey was not solely defined by his military service; Edward also found love and companionship. 
He married Edith on September 17, 1942, in Port Hastings, Nova Scotia, and the couple welcomed a daughter, Beverly Louise, in July 1943.

Tragically, Edward’s life was cut short on December 12, 1944, during intense fighting Casa Ferconi close to the right bank of the Naviglio Canal, Bagnacavallo. 
He was killed in action, leaving behind a young family, but his legacy endures as a testament to his sacrifice and dedication. Edward Prokaska was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot VII, Row A, Grave 8.

Sergeant Edward Prokaska’s story is one of commitment and courage, a life dedicated to service, and a reminder of the sacrifices made by so many young men during World War II. His family, comrades, and those who honor his memory continue to hold him in their hearts as a true Canadian hero.
