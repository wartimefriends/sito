Earl MARKS was born on August 28, 1917, in Cannington, Ontario, and raised in a family with strong ties to the community. He was the fourth child of Archibald John (deceased) and Ellen Ethel Marks, who later remarried and lived in Beaverton, Ontario. Earl had a close relationship with his mother, who remarried his late father’s brother, and his family included one brother, Alfred William, and two half-sisters, Mrs. Van Slyck and Mrs. Calderone.

Earl left school after completing Grade 10 in a technical program, where he studied architecture. He had to leave school early to help support his widowed mother, demonstrating a sense of responsibility and duty that would later mark his military service. Earl took on various jobs, including work as a carpenter’s helper, a delivery boy, a private chauffeur, and later as an assistant shipper in the wool department at Canada Packers Ltd., where he earned $30 a week. His dream was to one day become a motor mechanic, but life took him in a different direction when he was called to serve his country.

On May 5, 1943, Earl enlisted in the Canadian Army in Toronto, joining the #2 District Depot and later the Perth Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps. At enlistment, he was described as a likeable and easygoing young man with good development, blue eyes, and a cooperative nature. Earl showed superior intelligence on his aptitude tests, and his assessors found him alert, observant, and possessing a strong learning capacity. He had two years of experience with the High School Cadets, which helped him adapt well to military life. Earl’s hobbies included woodwork and casual sports such as hunting, skating, swimming, and rugby.

After his enlistment, Earl’s military journey began with training in Canada from May 1943 to September 1943. He was then sent to the United Kingdom on September 14, 1943, for further training before being deployed to Italy in February 1944. Earl’s performance was marked by a steady and committed attitude, and his officers noted his cheerfulness, reliability, and keen attention to detail. Despite not having specific trade skills, he was seen as promising material for infantry training and was considered a potential candidate for non-commissioned officer roles. 
In May 1944, he was wounded in action and hospitalized briefly but returned to service in July 1944, resilient and ready to continue.

Private Marks’s commitment and courage in the line of duty culminated during the Italian Campaign, where he fought valiantly alongside his fellow soldiers. 
Tragically, on December 27, 1944, at the age of 27, Earl Marks was killed in action along the right bank of the Senio River. 
He is laid to rest at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot III C 7.

Earl Marks is remembered as a young man of quiet resolve, someone who faced adversity with steady courage and a willingness to serve beyond himself. 
His family, friends, and community remember him for his cheerful, pleasant personality and dedication. 
Although his ambition of becoming a motor mechanic was cut short, his sacrifice and service will remain a lasting testament to his strength, resilience, and honorable character.
