title = "Michael T. TONARY, served with the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. He tragically lost his life on December 14, 1944 at the age of 25."
+++

He was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery,  plot V- A -8.

Born on July 23, 1919, in New Waterford, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Michael grew up in the close-knit community of Scotchtown, where he later resided at the time of his enlistment. He was the son of Thomas Tonary and Nora (Currie) Tonary. 
Sadly, Michael’s mother passed away when he was just three years old, leaving his father to raise him and his siblings. He had two brothers, Francis and David L., and one sister, Mrs. Robert McDonnell.

Michael’s early life was shaped by the challenges of growing up without a mother, but he persevered, completing his education up to Grade 10. By 1937, at the age of 18, he had begun working as a coal miner (loader) for the Dominion Steel and Coal Company in New Waterford. Over the next five years, he earned a weekly wage of $35.00, and his connection to the industry was solidified through his membership in the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), the miners’ trade union. The company promised him a job upon his return from the war, indicating his value as a worker.

In addition to his work in the mines, Michael was active in sports, excelling in swimming, hockey, as a right-winger and basketball, as a forward, showcasing his athletic abilities and physical stamina.
5’7” high and weighing 145 lbs, he was described as having a sturdy and pleasing physical appearance, with brown eyes. He was known for being quiet, reserved, and polite, speaking with a soft, low voice that conveyed a sense of calm, though perhaps tinged with indifference. Despite his quiet demeanor, he was stable and reliable, traits that served him well in his military career.

On May 26, 1940, Michael married Catherine Annie, and they had a son, Lawrence Duncan, born on October 16, 1941. His wife was supportive of his military service, which likely eased the burden of his decision to enlist. On August 6, 1942, he joined the army in Halifax, Nova Scotia, driven by a desire to do his part in the war effort. 
Private Tonary served in several theaters during the war. After training in Canada from August 6, 1942, to December 29, 1942, he was sent to the United Kingdom, where he served until June 16, 1943. Following this, he was deployed to Italy, where he fought until his death on December 14, 1944. 
He was known for his quiet determination, answering questions with precision but showing little outward ambition. His calm, steady nature made him well-suited for the rigors of military life.

Though Private Tonary was described as indifferent at times, he was fully committed to his role in the 1st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment before being re-designated to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. He fought bravely, giving his life in the service of his country. 
His legacy lives on through his family and the community that remembers him, and his sacrifice is honored by his final resting place in Villanova War Cemetery.
