Private Ellis Martin Hansen’s life is a story of duty, resilience, and quiet dedication, emblematic of a generation that answered the call to serve during the Second World War. 
Born on May 12, 1920, in Rabbit Lake, Saskatchewan, Ellis was the ninth of eleven children in a large and hardworking family. His parents, Charles Martin and Lena, raised him alongside his two brothers, Lloyd and Wilfred, and eight sisters, Ethel, Christina, Vinnie, Clara, Iva, Pearl, Edna, and Ada. Growing up in a harmonious household, Ellis developed a strong work ethic and a sense of responsibility.

Ellis completed grade five before leaving school to help on the family farm, where he gained seven years of experience in mixed farming. Tall and well-built, standing at 5’11” and weighing 172 pounds, Ellis had a fair complexion, light brown hair, and blue eyes. His demeanor was described as earnest, quiet, and cooperative, with a neat and correct appearance that reflected his suitability for military life. He enjoyed sports such as hunting, swimming, and baseball, activities that showcased his physical strength and love for the outdoors.

On March 14, 1942, Ellis enlisted in the Canadian Army at Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, driven by a sense of duty. Initially assigned to the King’s Own Rifles of Canada Reserve Unit, he completed his basic and advanced training, preparing for active service. Despite his average map reading and military knowledge and limited mechanical aptitude, Ellis’s cooperative nature and determination made him a dependable soldier. 
He expressed a desire to serve as a driver in the Canadian Armoured Corps.

After a year and a half of service in Canada, Ellis was deployed to the United Kingdom on August 26, 1943, where he continued training and adapted to the demands of war. 
By October 25, 1943, he was sent to Italy, joining the grueling Italian Campaign. As a member of the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (PLDG), Ellis played a vital role in reconnaissance operations that required bravery, adaptability, and endurance.

The Italian Campaign was one of the most arduous theaters of the war, characterized by harsh terrain and intense enemy resistance. Ellis faced these challenges with steadfast dedication, exemplifying the courage of his regiment. 
Tragically, on December 13, 1944, during a reconnaissance mission, Ellis was killed in action at the age of 24.
Private Ellis Martin Hansen was laid to rest at Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot I.B.8. His grave is a solemn tribute to his sacrifice and a reminder of the countless lives given in the fight for freedom.

Ellis Hansen’s story is one of commitment and quiet heroism, from his early years on a Saskatchewan farm to the battlefields of Italy. Though his life was cut short, his legacy endures as a testament to the bravery and selflessness of those who served. Private Hansen’s sacrifice will forever be honored by his family, his comrades, and the generations who owe their freedom to individuals like him.
