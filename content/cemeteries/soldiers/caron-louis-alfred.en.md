D Company, Irish Regiment of Canada

Louis Alfred Caron was born on July 14, 1919, in Timmins, Ontario, to Alfred and Marie Caron. The second of five children, Louis grew up in a tight-knit family with his siblings—Charles Eugene, Mary Bianche (later Larkin), and Rita. 
A medium-complexioned young man with dark brown hair and brown eyes, Louis was known for his clean appearance, well-groomed style, and warm personality.

Educated up to the 10th grade, Louis pursued a trade as a machinist, demonstrating a keen ability with his hands and a love for craftsmanship. His hobbies included woodcraft and drafting, reflecting his creative and practical nature. Though not drawn to athletics, Louis enjoyed socializing and brought a reliable and stable presence to those around him.

As the Second World War raged, Louis answered the call to serve his country, enlisting on July 21, 1943, in Toronto, Ontario. 
He joined the #2 District Depot General List, embarking on a journey that would take him far from his hometown. 
Standing 5’7” and weighing 116 pounds, Louis carried himself with quiet determination. Proficient in both English and French, he brought valuable bilingual skills to his service.

Louis’s military service began in Canada, where he trained until August 3, 1944. He was then deployed to the United Kingdom, where he continued his preparation for the battlefield. 
On November 4, 1944, he arrived in Italy, where the war’s harsh realities awaited.

On December 18, 1944, Louis was taken on strength by the Irish Regiment of Canada, joining D Company in the Italian campaign. His time with the regiment was brief yet marked by his commitment and resolve.

On December 20, 1944, at the age of 25, Louis Alfred Caron was killed in action near the Fosso Munio, approximately 500 meters northeast of Bagnacavallo, Italy. His death occurred during the bitter fighting along the Senio River, where Allied forces faced fierce resistance from German troops. 
Records indicate that Louis was initially buried by the enemy, a stark reminder of the brutal conditions of war.

He was later interred with honor at the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot III, Row A, Grave 6, beside his comrade Private Mike Bernstein, who died the same day.

Louis’s service and sacrifice left an indelible mark on his family and community. Remembered as a kind, sociable, and skilled young man, his life was a testament to quiet dedication and unwavering duty. 
Though his journey was tragically short, the memory of Private Louis Alfred Caron endures, a symbol of the courage and sacrifice of those who gave everything for the freedom of future generations.
