title = "Private Richard Charles TAVIGNOT (B64565)"
+++


Born on November 16, 1920, in Quebec, Richard Charles Tavignot grew up as the eldest child in a family that included his father, Charles, his mother, Marie, his brother Maurice (who would also serve in the Irish Regiment of Canada), half-brother Marcel, and two sisters, Mary and Helene. His family would describe him as quiet, soft-spoken, generous, and caring. 
After he started working, Richard often bought gifts for his family, particularly for his mother, and would frequently hand his brother Maurice extra money to spend. He was a kind soul with a strong sense of responsibility toward his loved ones.

Richard attended high school but left after just a year to start working and contributing to his family’s income. He found work at the prestigious Royal York Hotel in Toronto as a waiter’s helper, or busboy, and later as a waiter. Despite his relatively modest job, Richard earned $9.00 a week, plus board and tips, which helped him support his family. He was noted to be a healthy, physically active young man, standing at 5’ 9 ½” and weighing 174 pounds, with brown eyes and a passion for sports such as hockey, baseball, swimming, and horseback riding.

On June 12, 1941, at the age of 20, Richard enlisted in the Canadian Army in Toronto. He began his military career with the Queen’s Own Rifles before transferring to the Perth Regiment in September 1941. His service would take him through Canada, the UK, and finally to Italy, where he arrived on October 27, 1943, to participate in the grueling Italian Campaign during World War II.

In Italy, Richard’s path crossed with that of his brother Maurice, who was serving in the Irish Regiment of Canada. The brothers had not seen each other in a year and a half and were finally able to spend a few days together on leave in the Italian city of Bari. That reunion, filled with joy and emotion, would be one of their last moments together.

On December 15, 1944, just a few weeks before Richard’s death, the brothers unexpectedly ran into each other again. While taking cover in a bombed-out farmhouse during heavy German shelling, Maurice heard a familiar voice nearby. It was Richard, seeking shelter with his comrades. The brothers embraced, and despite the dire circumstances, they shared a moment of relief and love. Before they parted ways, Richard expressed his hopes that at least one of them would survive the war to take care of their parents and sisters back home.

Just over two weeks later, on January 2, 1945, Richard was killed in action alongside his good friend Fred Hootun by the Lamone River in the area of Conventello.
Maurice, stationed nearby with the Irish Regiment, was part of a burial detail that day. Unbeknownst to him, while he was burying two of his fallen comrades, another burial party just 150 feet away was laying his brother Richard to rest. It wasn’t until two days later that Maurice learned the heartbreaking news that his brother had been killed in the same battle. He later visited Richard’s grave at the temporary cemetery and discovered that he had unknowingly attended his brother’s funeral.

Richard Charles Tavignot’s body was eventually moved to its final resting place in the Villanova War Cemetery, Plot II, Row B, Grave 8, where he lies among his comrades who gave their lives during one of the most brutal chapters of the Second World War. 
His brother Maurice’s memories of Richard remain a poignant tribute to a quiet, generous young man who gave everything for his country and his family.




Letter to Pte Richard Charles Tavignot written by Drew Leblanc, member of a Canadian hockey team who visited the Cemetery in April 2009.

Dear Sir,
I would first like to thank you for the sacrifices you made in securing democracy and rights of humans everywhere.
I can't imagine what an honor it must have been to fight for your country and believes.
However, it must have been very scary and unnerving thinking about battle and also fighting.
Your sacrifice has lead to many of the freedom that the rest of Canada and I enjoy every day.
I also respect your initiative to put your life on hold and fight alongside your family and friends to defend your life and way of living. 
I learned that you were a hockey player and you were a bus boy.
l'm also playing hockey and enjoy working as a bus boy at a local restaurant.
I hope that you can understand my feelings towards you, and you understand my respect and thankfulness towards your sacrifice.
Thank you.
Sincerely, 

			Drew LeBlanc
