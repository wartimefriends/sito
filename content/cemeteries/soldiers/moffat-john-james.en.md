John enlisted on September 8, 1942, and initially served with the Number 10 District Depot, 3rd Battalion of the Royal Rifles. He had prior military experience, having served with the 2nd Battalion of the Queen’s Own Cameron Highlanders from March 1941 until his enlistment in September 1942. He trained at Gordon Head and qualified as a lieutenant on January 1, 1943. He went overseas with the 2nd Canadian Infantry Reinforcement Unit.

His service took him to various regions: he served in Canada from April 8, 1942, to June 16, 1943, in the United Kingdom from June 17, 1943, to October 26, 1943, and finally in Italy from October 27, 1943, until his death. John joined the Irish Regiment of Canada on October 19, 1943, while in the UK.

On December 22, 1944, Lieutenant John Moffat was killed in action while leading a fighting patrol at the Senio River in Italy.
