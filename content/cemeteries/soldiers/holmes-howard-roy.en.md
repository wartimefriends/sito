<br>


Trooper Howard Roy Holmes, served with the 3rd Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, Governor General’s Horse Guards, of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. 

Born on June 14, 1920, in Owen Sound, Ontario, Howard was the eldest of four siblings and grew up in a family marked by hardship and resilience. His father, Elmer Roy Holmes, and mother, Helen Ada Holmes, separated when he was just six years old, and Howard was subsequently raised by his grandmother.

Howard completed his education through Grade 8, leaving school at 16 to work and contribute to his family. He found steady employment as a farm laborer in the Georgian Bay District, gaining extensive experience in mixed farming and working with horses. Farming became his passion, and he aspired to one day own his own farm. Before enlisting, he earned $10 a week with room and board, demonstrating his strong work ethic and dedication.

Standing 5’8” and weighing 145 pounds, Howard had blue eyes and a fair complexion. He was described as quiet but cooperative, with a pleasant demeanor and a keen interest in engines and mechanics. An avid outdoorsman, he enjoyed hunting, fishing, and swimming, as well as playing hockey and soccer in local leagues.

Howard enlisted in the Canadian Army on December 14, 1942, in Toronto, Ontario, answering the call to serve. Initially trained as part of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps (R.C.A.C.), he showed enthusiasm for his duties and expressed a preference for work in the Armoured Corps. While not initially qualified for a specific trade, he demonstrated determination and adaptability, completing training as a Gunner Operator in November 1943. His instructors described him as earnest, cooperative, and emotionally stable, with the potential to become a steady and reliable soldier.

After completing his training in Canada, Howard was deployed to the United Kingdom in November 1943, where he further honed his skills. 
By March 1944, he was sent to Italy as part of the grueling Italian Campaign. Despite the challenging terrain and relentless combat conditions, Howard remained committed to his duties, embodying the resilience and resolve for which Canadian soldiers were known.

Tragically, Howard’s service was cut short on December 23, 1944, when he was killed in action at the age of 24. His loss was compounded by the earlier death of his younger brother, Douglas Murray Holmes, who had been killed in Sicily in July 1943 while serving with the Irish Regiment. Another brother, George Wallace Holmes, was serving overseas at the time of Howard’s death, while Kenneth Milton remained in Toronto.

Howard was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, where his grave in Plot V, Row C, Grave 5 stands as a testament to his sacrifice.

Trooper Howard Roy Holmes lived a life defined by quiet determination and dedication. From his early years working on farms in Ontario to his service on the battlefields of Italy, Howard exemplified the values of resilience, duty, and service. His legacy, like that of so many others, endures as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made during World War II.

From the GGHG’s War Diary:

Just before first light on 24 December 'A' Squadron moved cross country to Via Bellaria, waiting for first light to move north toward the Via Rosetta. As this move was taking place, the forward Stuart of Murray's Second Troop was knocked out at close range by a panzerfaust. When the crew bailed out they were engaged by machine guns, and Troopers Norman Cameron and Howard Homes were killed.
