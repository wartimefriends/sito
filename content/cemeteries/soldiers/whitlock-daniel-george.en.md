Daniel George WHITLOCK was born on November 20, 1915, in French River, Prince Edward Island. He grew up in a stable household, the eldest child of George Edwin and Roberta Whitlock. He had one brother, Elmer, who served as a driver in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and two half-sisters, Marion and Pauline. Daniel left school after completing the 8th grade, working in various trades to support himself and his family. He developed a passion for mechanics and carpentry, often working on trucks and creating furniture for his home. His hobbies included hunting, playing hockey as a center, and baseball.

On June 7, 1939, Daniel married Ruth, and together they had two children: Donald Alexander and Carrol Elizabeth. They resided in Kensington, PEI, and he provided for his family by working as a truck driver, interior and exterior decorator, and a fireman tending to coal-burning boilers. For five years, he split his time between painting houses and trucking gravel during the summers, earning about $20 a week. His experience with trucks gave him a solid understanding of engines and mechanical work, an area in which he showed great skill.

Daniel’s military journey began when he enlisted on September 1, 1939, in Charlottetown, PEI, joining the Prince Edward Island Highlanders. Prior to that, he had already been part of the Non-Permanent Active Militia (N.P.A.M.), demonstrating his eagerness to contribute to Canada’s war effort. Over the next several years, he completed both basic and advanced training, serving in a variety of roles, including as a cook for 18 months, where he became qualified and later transferred to the Motor Transport (M.T.) section as a driver. His mechanical aptitude earned him certifications as a wheeled vehicle driver, Class II, and he was awarded a Good Conduct Badge in recognition of his exemplary behavior and reliability.

Daniel was known as a pleasant and capable soldier, described as cheerful and friendly, with a neat appearance. He was not particularly aggressive but had a natural leadership quality, though not suited for parade square duties. His superiors praised his work ethic, noting his reliability and competence, particularly as a driver. Despite his relatively quiet demeanor, Daniel took initiative and was always eager to improve, showing a keen interest in the automotive trade. He expressed a desire to continue training as a driver mechanic, a field where he excelled.

On July 19, 1943, Daniel was deployed overseas to the UK, where he further honed his skills, completing several training programs and gaining valuable experience. In March 1944, he was sent to Italy, where he joined the brutal fighting of the Italian Campaign. On September 18, 1944, he was promoted to Lance Corporal, recognizing his leadership and expertise. A little over a month later, on October 26, 1944, his unit was redesignated as part of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps.

Tragically, on December 14, 1944, Lance Corporal Daniel George Whitlock was killed in action in Italy, during one of the most difficult phases of the war. He was laid to rest at Villanova War Cemetery, in Italy, in Plot VI, Row A, Grave 3.

Daniel Whitlock’s legacy is one of dedication, both to his family and to his country. From his humble beginnings in Prince Edward Island, he grew into a skilled tradesman and a reliable soldier, always eager to improve and provide for those he loved. His sacrifice on the battlefield serves as a lasting testament to his courage and commitment, leaving behind a family and a grateful nation that honors his memory.
