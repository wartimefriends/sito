John Henry Frisby was born on March 28, 1912, in Leicester, Hinckley, England, to Charles Wetstone and Mary Elizabeth Frisby. Raised on a farm, John gained five years of experience in dairy farming but later transitioned to a career as a florist. After immigrating to Canada, he settled in Langley Prairie, British Columbia, and worked as a section foreman at Langley Greenhouses Ltd., a position he held for 14 years prior to enlistment. Though he excelled in horticulture, John harbored ambitions of becoming a carpenter after the war, fueled by his passion for woodworking.

John completed three years of high school at Aberdare Intermediate School in Glamorgan, UK, before leaving school at 16. By the time of his enlistment, he had established a family life, marrying Nancy Beatrice on September 6, 1939. 
Together, they had a daughter, also named Nancy Beatrice, and resided in Langley Prairie, BC.

On November 6, 1942, John enlisted in the Canadian Army in Vancouver, BC, joining the Westminster Regiment (Motorized). At the time, he had already served in the reserve unit, the 2nd (Reserve) Battalion of the Westminster Regiment, where he had attained the rank of sergeant. 
John’s military career progressed rapidly. Just a week after enlisting, he was recommended for officer training and attended the Officers’ Training Centre in Three Rivers, Quebec. He completed his training successfully and was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant on February 13, 1943, with a further promotion to full Lieutenant by April of the same year.

Standing 5’8” tall and weighing 143 pounds, John was a fair-haired, blue-eyed individual known for his dedication and competence. His military service was marked by his adaptability and determination, qualities that earned him respect from his peers and superiors alike.

John served in Canada until May 1943, when he was deployed to the United Kingdom. In November 1943, he joined the Italian Campaign, where the Westminster Regiment played a pivotal role in the Allied push to liberate Italy. The campaign was grueling, with harsh conditions and relentless combat against entrenched German forces.

On September 23, 1944, John was wounded in action, necessitating medical evacuation to the 1st Canadian General Hospital. He was later transferred to the 5th Canadian General Hospital and discharged on November 13, 1944. 
Despite his injuries, he returned to his unit, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to his comrades and the mission.

Tragically, Lieutenant John Henry Frisby was killed in action on December 28, 1944, during operations near Villanova, Italy.
From the Westminster War Diary -28 Dec. 44:
… In this attack Lieut. J.H. Frisby and Cpl Regota were killed and seven others were wounded …
John was 32 years old. He was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery, where his grave stands as a testament to his bravery and sacrifice.

John’s story reflects a life of service, from his early days on a farm in England to his role as a leader on the battlefields of Italy. His dedication to his family, his work, and his country exemplifies the values of his generation. 
Though his life was tragically cut short, Lieutenant John Henry Frisby’s legacy lives on in the memory of his loved ones and the history of those who fought for freedom.
