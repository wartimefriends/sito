John attended school until the 10th grade but left at the age of 15 to help support his family. Throughout his early years, he displayed a keen interest in sports, enjoying activities like skating, playing defense in hockey, and holding the position of first base in baseball. His hobbies included working with engines, which indicated his developing interest in mechanics.

Before enlisting, John worked as a truck driver for various firms, finding intermittent employment in the transport industry. He also worked as a locksmith, making and repairing locks, and had brief experience with Bell Telephone as a line constructor in Owen Sound. Although his work history was varied, he consistently showed an interest in mechanical and technical skills, even attending a night school course in diesel engineering, though he was unable to complete it.

Driven by a sense of patriotism, John enlisted in the Canadian military on July 6, 1940, in Toronto, Ontario. He was initially assigned to the 2nd Canadian Pioneer Battalion of the Royal Canadian Engineers (RCE) and quickly transitioned into his role within the 5 Mechanical Equipment Platoon. Standing at 5’10” and weighing 170 pounds, John had blue eyes and a solid build, fitting for a soldier with aspirations to advance in transport work.

Despite his enthusiasm for mechanical and technical roles, John found himself somewhat discontented in the army. He had hoped to pursue a Driver Mechanics Course and focus on transport work, but instead, he was assigned to the role of a medical orderly—a position he did not enjoy and one that left him feeling embittered. He expressed dissatisfaction about being kept in a role that didn’t align with his skills and interests.

Throughout his military career, John served in various theaters, starting in Canada from July 1940 until August 1940, followed by a deployment to the UK from August 1940 to June 1943. He was then sent to Italy, where he served from June 1943 until his death in December 1944. His service was marked by periods of misconduct; he was a chronic offender of being Absent Without Leave (AWL), which led to detentions in both barracks and British military prisons.

On December 20, 1944, John Aubrey Shouldice was killed in action while serving in Italy. He was just 26 years old. His final resting place is in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he is commemorated with honor for his service and sacrifice. Despite his struggles with the roles he was assigned, John’s dedication to his country and his determination to serve remained evident throughout his military career. His story is one of a young man who, despite personal disappointments and challenges, gave his life in service to his nation.
