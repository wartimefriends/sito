Emmanuel Markus Sparrow was born on December 25, 1920, in Glace Bay, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. He was one of ten children born to Dr Cecil John and Helen Josephine Sparrow. He grew up in Reserve Mines, a small mining town in Nova Scotia, and attended the local Roman Catholic church with his family. He completed Grade 9 at the age of 16 before beginning work with his father, Dr. C.J. Sparrow, as an assistant in various odd jobs. Before enlisting  Emmanuel had hoped to follow in his  father’s footsteps and become a doctor. 

Standing 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 155 pounds, with blue eyes, Emmanuel was athletic and enjoyed sports, including swimming, softball, and soccer. His sense of duty led him to enlist in the army on October 14, 1939, in Sydney, Nova Scotia, at the young age of 18. Emmanuel joined the Cape Breton Highlanders, B Company, driven by his commitment to serve his country. His enlistment came shortly after the outbreak of World War II, and he quickly took on responsibilities as a soldier.

While serving in Canada, Emmanuel married Helen Margaret, but the couple had no children. His deep devotion to his wife led to several instances of being absent without leave (AWL) during his time stationed in Canada, likely out of a desire to spend more time with her. Despite these absences, Emmanuel was seen as a dedicated soldier, someone who was cooperative, well-suited for military life, and a natural leader who enjoyed organizing sports for his fellow soldiers.

Sparrow’s military career saw him transferred to the United Kingdom on November 11, 1941, where he served until October 23, 1943. During this time, he attended a demolitions course at the Canadian Engineers Reinforcement Unit and steadily rose through the ranks. His disciplined nature and strong organizational skills earned him the rank of Company Quartermaster Sergeant. In October 1943, Emmanuel was sent to Italy to join the Italian Campaign, a pivotal theater of World War II, where Canadian forces played a crucial role in liberating the country from Axis powers.

Emmanuel’s brothers also served in the military: Edward fought with the Canadian Army in Italy, Joseph Gerard served in England, and Henry Cecil and Alexander Douglas both served in the Royal Canadian Air Force (R.C.A.F.). His sister Elaine May worked as a nurse at Camp Hill Hospital in Halifax, while another sister, Mary Muriel, passed away in June 1930.

During his service, Emmanuel was seen as a reliable and capable leader. He had a deep sense of duty and was well-liked among his comrades. His service in Italy exposed him to some of the fiercest fighting, as Allied forces sought to break through German defensive lines.

Tragically, on January 3, 1945, at the age of 23, Emmanuel Markus Sparrow was killed in action in the area between Conventello and Sant’Alberto. He was with Randy Ducko, formerly from Donkin, and were transporting rations. Without knowing it, they travelled too far into enemy territory and were surrounded by the Germans. Emmanuel raised for his tommy machine gun in a desperate effort to beat the odds and wipe out the enemy. Unfortunately his efforts were not enough.  
He gave his life in the service of his country, and he now rests at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, Grave III B 5, a lasting testament to his sacrifice and commitment.

Emmanuel’s life, though short, was marked by his strong sense of responsibility to both his family and his country. His dedication, leadership, and willingness to serve leave behind a legacy that continues to honor the contributions of those who fought and died during the Second World War.

Letter to us providing more information received from Joseph, Emmanuel’s brother 

Well, let me tell you about my family.
My father was a Doctor in the 1st World War; our mother  was left to raise some of the children . After the war he returned home to practice his profession and along came more children making our family (9).
Emmanuel kept in touch with Mom and Dad faithfully.
He really wanted to come home for a White Christmas. Mom was sad every time she heard the song.
Emmanuel got married before he went overseas, maybe around eighteen. His wife left for out west shortly after he was killed . She never kept in touch with us.
My father told us Emmanuel came to the foot of his bed when he was in Hospital.  And was not really shocked when my mother told him Emmanuel was killed..
It broke my Mother’s heart. She never got over it. She went from a beautiful auburn hair mother to a little white haired Lady when we all returned from the war.
So in closing, just hope this will give you an idea what we all went through.
Enclosing a few photos which is all we have.
I remain,

                                               Joseph Sparrow
