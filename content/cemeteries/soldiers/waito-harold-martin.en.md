title = "Private Harold Martin WAITO was born on February 17, 1925, in Ottawa, Ontario. Growing up, Harold faced the challenges of a separated household. His father, Harry E. Waito, ran a garage and taxi business in Ottawa, while his mother, Edith, lived elsewhere. Harold spent much of his youth working on his uncle’s farm, particularly during the summers, and spent winters laboring in lumber camps for $2.00 a day. Despite the complexities of his family life, Harold maintained a quiet, cooperative demeanor and developed a strong work ethic."

He completed his education up to Grade 8 at the age of 14, attending public school in Ottawa and later a country school in Petawawa. After leaving school, Harold worked for his father, helping out at the family garage and driving taxis. His experience as a driver made him adept at handling vehicles, and by his teenage years, Harold even owned a car. Although he was a slight youth, standing at just 5’4” and weighing 117 pounds, Harold was considered to have a good physique and was given an A-1 health classification upon enlistment.

Harold enlisted in the Canadian Army on August 31, 1943, in Kingston, Ontario. Motivated by a sense of duty, he began his military journey with No. 3-A District Depot. Despite health complaints, Harold was found suitable for service and began basic and advanced infantry training. Although he expressed uncertainty about his exact age, due to a lost birth certificate, he was eventually cleared for overseas deployment.

After completing his training, Harold was sent to the United Kingdom in April 1944 and later to Italy in May 1944. He initially served with the Irish Regiment of Canada before being transferred to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (PLDG), a regiment within the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. During his time in Italy, Harold was wounded in August 1944 but returned to his unit after recovery.

By the time he was transferred to the 4th PLDG in July 1944, Harold had completed advanced training in machine gunnery and was considered capable of further development as part of the overseas reinforcement. Despite his relatively young age, Harold had already proven himself on the battlefield.

Tragically, Harold’s service was cut short when he was killed in action on December 22, 1944, at the age of 19, during the grueling Italian Campaign. He was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery, in Plot V, Row C, Grave 8. Harold’s life, though brief, was marked by a strong sense of duty and service to his country. His contribution to the war effort, along with the sacrifices he made, are remembered with honor.
