title = "Private Stephen LAZAROFF: A Life of Service and Sacrifice"
+++


Private Stephen Lazaroff, Service Number 851770, served with the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps. 
Born on March 2, 1922, in Toronto, Ontario, Stephen grew up as the fifth of ten children in a large Macedonian-Canadian family. His parents, Sotir, a coal salesman, and Trena, worked hard to support their children, who all contributed to the household. His brothers George and Sam also served in the Canadian Army, while his sisters Olga, Helen, Mary, and Sophie provided support at home.

Stephen attended school until Grade 5, leaving early to help support his family. Despite limited formal education, he developed a strong work ethic, working as a baker’s helper for Charles Yeast Donuts and as a restaurant waiter at Paul’s Lunch in Toronto. Known for his cheerful and athletic disposition, Stephen enjoyed gym and baseball but never learned to swim. Though he had faced challenges during his youth, including delinquent behavior, he matured into a reliable and hardworking individual.

Standing 5’8” and weighing 146 pounds, Stephen was described as neat in appearance, cheerful, and dependable. His determination and willingness to endure hard work, provided it was shared fairly, made him well-suited for military service. On April 25, 1941, Stephen enlisted in the Canadian Army in Brampton, Ontario, joining The Lorne Scots (Peel, Dufferin, and Halton Regiment). He later transferred to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment.

After basic training in Canada, Stephen embarked for the United Kingdom on June 22, 1941, where he continued his military preparation for over two years. 
In August 1943, he was deployed to Italy as part of the grueling Italian Campaign, a key theater in the Allied efforts during World War II. Known for its harsh terrain and relentless combat, the campaign tested the physical and emotional limits of every soldier.

Stephen’s dedication to duty and cheerful spirit carried him through some of the war’s most challenging battles. 
On December 11, 1944, he was officially transferred to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. Tragically, just three days later, on December 14, 1944, Stephen was killed in action at the age of 22.

He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where his grave in Plot VII, Row C, Grave 2 stands as a testament to his sacrifice and service.

Private Stephen Lazaroff’s life was one of resilience, growth, and unwavering commitment. From his early days helping his family in Toronto to his service on the battlefields of Italy, Stephen embodied the strength and determination of his generation. 
His sacrifice, like that of so many others, remains a poignant reminder of the cost of freedom and the courage of those who gave everything in its pursuit.


To Pte Stephen Lazaroff from Cody Carter, a Canadian student visiting the Villanova War Cemetery with his Hockey Team

Dear Sir:

       Hi! My name is Cody Carter, I am 15 years old, I have been studying you for the
past month as a project for my hockey team. I couldn't imagine being as young as 21
years old and having to fight in a war. It must have been really hard to leave your family
and friends and go off and fight in a war and knowing that you might never return and
see them again.
       I think 21 is too young of an age to have to go and fight in a war because you
would still have your whole life ahead of you. When I am 21 1 imagine myself in college
just barely beginning my grown up life. I think that it is terrible that you were killed at
such a young age and robbed of all the things that life could have offered you. It must
have been really scary in the war knowing that you could die at any second. You must
have had a lot of courage to always push on and try and gain more ground in the battle.
I am relieved the world is at peace right now because it would be absolutely
terrible if more people were put through what you had to go through. I am also very
thankful that you did go to war because if it wasn't for you and your fellow soldiers the
world wouldn't be such a nice place to live. You are a hero and I will always think
of you on your birthday, March second.

Sincerely,

Cody Carter
