Ernest completed his education up to the 10th grade, demonstrating a commitment to learning during his formative years. Fluent in both English and French, he possessed valuable communication skills that would serve him well in both civilian and military life. His hobbies included philately—the collection and study of stamps—reflecting a keen eye for detail and appreciation for history.

An avid sportsman, Ernest participated in swimming, badminton, boxing, baseball, and basketball. These activities showcased his athleticism, teamwork, and discipline. His physical attributes included a height of nearly 5 feet 7 inches and a weight of 162 pounds, with blue eyes, brown hair, and a fair complexion.

Professionally, Ernest worked as an accountant for American Perfumeries in Montreal, located in the Reid Building. Over four years, he proved himself a reliable and dedicated employee. His employer valued his contributions highly and promised him a position upon his return from military service.

Motivated by a sense of duty, Ernest enlisted in the Canadian Army on September 12, 1939, in Montreal, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. He joined the 1st Battalion of The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada. His initial service in Canada lasted until August 22, 1940, after which he was deployed to the United Kingdom, arriving on August 23, 1940.

During his time in the UK from 1940 to 1943, Ernest enhanced his military skills and attended courses to become a carrier driver, specializing in operating Bren carriers—light armored vehicles used to transport infantry and equipment. His military specialties included serving as a section leader in charge of these carriers. While noted for his stable and cooperative nature, some observed that his easy-going demeanor might have limited his advancement to non-commissioned officer roles.

In July 1944, Ernest was taken on strength by the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, a regiment of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. This transfer marked a significant chapter in his military career, focusing on the intense combat of the Italian Campaign. Arriving in Italy on October 25, 1943, he became an integral part of the Allied efforts to liberate the country from Axis forces.

Tragically, Private Ernest Anthony Piggott was killed in action on December 13, 1944, at the age of 25. His death was a profound loss to his family and comrades, who remembered him for his dedication, cheerful disposition, and the sacrifice he made for his country. He was laid to rest at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot II, Row C, Grave 1.

Remembered for his commitment and bravery, Private Piggott’s story is a poignant reminder of the countless individuals who gave their lives during World War II. His service exemplifies the courage and determination of those who stood against tyranny, and his legacy continues to be honored by his family, community, and nation.
