Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, R.C.I.C.

William J. Burinot was born on October 28, 1919, in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. The son of William and Mary (Sehl) Burinot, William was raised in a close-knit family on Scateria Island, Cape Breton. He grew up alongside his two brothers, Thomas Leo and Basil Andrew, and five sisters, Catherine, Annie, Elizabeth, Dorothy, and Evangeline. William’s childhood was described as happy, filled with love and support from his family.

William attended school until the age of 15, completing six years of public education. He began working as a fisherman at a young age, a trade that defined much of his life. For over 11 years, he dedicated himself to the fishing industry, honing his skills and developing a deep connection to the sea. Though his work was demanding, William found fulfillment in the rhythms of life on the water, and he hoped to return to fishing after the war.

An avid sportsman, William enjoyed hunting, playing hockey as a defenseman, and participating in softball, where he excelled as an outfielder. Standing 5’8½” tall and weighing 155 pounds, he was a strong and capable young man with hazel-brown eyes, fair hair, and a fair complexion.

On February 1, 1942, William was called up for military service and enlisted in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. Initially assigned to the 61st Canadian Army Basic Training Centre (C.A. (B) T.C.), he trained as a gunner, a role he enjoyed and excelled in. His superiors described him as cooperative, hardworking, and eager to learn, noting his potential to take on greater responsibilities within a gun detachment.

After completing his training in Canada, William was deployed to the United Kingdom in August 1942. There, he continued to develop his skills in preparation for combat. In June 1943, he joined the Italian Campaign, one of the most grueling and pivotal theaters of the Second World War.

In October 1944, William was reassigned to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. As part of this infantry unit, he faced intense combat in the final months of the Italian Campaign.

On December 19, 1944, during operations at Villa Prati- Bagnacavallo, Private William J. Burinot was killed in action. He was just 25 years old. 
His death marked a profound loss for his family, who had cherished his presence and eagerly awaited his return, and for his comrades, who admired his dedication and spirit.

Private William J. Burinot was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot V, Row C, Grave 9. His grave stands as a testament to his courage and sacrifice, a reminder of the price paid for freedom.

William’s story is one of resilience, dedication, and selflessness. From his upbringing in a loving family to his years as a fisherman and his ultimate sacrifice on the battlefields of Italy, he exemplified the values of duty and honor that defined his generation.

Though his life was tragically brief, William’s legacy endures in the hearts of his family, the history of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, and the gratitude of a nation. 
His memory reminds us of the sacrifices made by so many to secure the freedoms we cherish today.


From Perry White’s memoires [Pte White was one of William’s comrades and a good friend of his]:

Burinot:
It was a habit of the Sargent that whenever there was a lull in the gunfire, he would go along to each trench and make sure that everyone was okay. It was on that night that he came along to our trench and asked how we were and we assured him we were okay. Then he looked at me and said: "This is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do Whitey, but your buddy Jack Burinot got it tonight. He just didn't make it. A shell burst right in the trench, killing all three of them". 
Now the day before this, during the shelling, we had looked out of our trench and seen Jack crawling on his stomach towards our trench. When he got there we hauled him in and really scolded him for doing such a dangerous thing. He looked at me and said: " But I just had to talk to you Whitey, to show you something". Now he had told me a few weeks earlier that he had written a letter back home to Canada, proposing to his girlfriend. He had just received a letter from her and insisted that I read it. In the letter she had accepted his proposal and his mother and hers were already preparing for the wedding. A wedding that would never happen. 
After our Sargent went away, the other fellows and I stood there talking about Jack.They all knew that Jack and I had been close and what a good fellow he was.
