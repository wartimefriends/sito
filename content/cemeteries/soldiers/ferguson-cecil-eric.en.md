<br>


Cecil Eric Ferguson was born on March 19, 1923, in Kentville, Kings County, Nova Scotia, to James and Bertha Blanche Ferguson. He was one of four children, with an older brother, James Malcolm, and two sisters, Alberta (Mrs. Willard Ellis) and Jean (Mrs. Cameron McPherson). Raised in Kentville, Cecil grew up in a family shaped by strong community values and a legacy of service, as his father was a veteran of the First World War.

Cecil attended school until the 11th grade, leaving at age 18 to enlist in the Canadian Army on April 11, 1942. Though he had only completed seven months of his final year, Cecil demonstrated superior intelligence and a natural aptitude for both language and numerical tasks. Before enlisting, he worked as a hardware store clerk for R.D. Chisholm in Kentville, earning $8 a week. His hobbies and interests included woodworking, skiing, hunting, swimming, hockey (as a defenseman), and baseball (where he excelled as a pitcher and third baseman). Cecil dreamed of becoming a mechanic and expressed an interest in continuing work as a clerk or farmer after the war.

At 5’10½” tall and weighing 125 pounds, Cecil had blue eyes, blonde hair, and a fair complexion. His neat appearance, pleasant demeanor, and cooperative nature made him well-liked by his peers and commanding officers. Despite a history of health challenges, including a ruptured appendix and a sinus operation, Cecil was in good health at the time of his enlistment and showed no complaints about his physical condition. Described as ambitious, he eagerly sought opportunities for trades training, hoping to gain skills that would benefit him after the war.

Cecil’s enlistment was driven by a profound sense of duty. Before joining active service, he had spent seven years as a Sergeant Major in the 266 K.C.A. Cadets, gaining leadership skills and discipline. After enlisting, he underwent training in Canada and was deployed to the United Kingdom on August 8, 1942. There, he honed his abilities and prepared for the realities of combat. 
In September 1944, Cecil joined the Italian Campaign as part of the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, a regiment tasked with reconnaissance missions critical to the Allied advance.

Cecil’s time in Italy was tragically brief but marked by courage and commitment. On December 22, 1944, he was killed in action near Fosso Munio, during intense combat operations against German forces. 
He was just 20 years old.

Private Cecil Eric Ferguson was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where his grave serves as a poignant reminder of his service and sacrifice. His journey from a small-town hardware store to the front lines of Italy embodies the spirit of dedication and resilience of his generation.

Though his life was cut short, Cecil’s memory endures in the hearts of his family and the history of those who gave everything for the pursuit of peace and freedom. 
His story reflects not only the sacrifices of war but also the hopes and aspirations of a young man who sought to make a difference in the world.
