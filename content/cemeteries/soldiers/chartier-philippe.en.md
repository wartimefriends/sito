Private Philippe Chartier was born on January 7, 1914, in St.-François, Richmond County, Province of Quebec. One of eleven children in a large, blended family, Philippe grew up in difficult circumstances. 
His father, André, passed away in 1945, and his mother, Lodia (also called Laudis), raised her children amidst significant challenges. Philippe had three full brothers—Wilfrid, Hormishas, and Lucien—and four full sisters—Alice, Yvonne (Madame Bachand), Adorina, and Florence—as well as several half-siblings, including Alphonse, Leopold, and Hector.

Philippe completed Grade 8 before leaving school to support himself and his family. His early years were shaped by resilience and hard work, as he took on various roles, including working as a general helper at a repair shop for Canada Paper Company in Windsor Mills, Quebec, and as a waiter at Gims Lunch in Montreal. 
These experiences highlighted his adaptability and determination.

At 5’10” tall and weighing 160 pounds, Philippe was a strong and capable young man with brown eyes and a determined demeanor. His hobbies included hunting, fishing, and playing baseball, particularly during his school years. Bilingual in French and English, Philippe was well-equipped to navigate the diverse environments he encountered.

On February 23, 1940, Philippe enlisted in the Canadian Army, driven by the need for employment and a desire to serve. 
He initially joined the Royal 22e Regiment (CASF), beginning his training in Canada before deploying to the United Kingdom in May 1940. Over the next several years, he prepared for the challenges of combat, demonstrating a strong work ethic and a willingness to contribute wherever he was needed.

In February 1944, Philippe was deployed to Italy, joining the Allied forces in one of the most grueling theaters of the Second World War. In October 1944, he was reassigned to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, where he served with distinction during the Italian Campaign.

Tragically, on December 14, 1944, Philippe was killed in action during intense combat near Villa Prati, Italy. A letter from his family later revealed that he was shot in the heart, a wound that claimed his life instantly. He was 30 years old.

Private Philippe Chartier was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot VI, Row A, Grave 2. His grave stands as a solemn tribute to his life of service and sacrifice.

Philippe’s journey, from a modest upbringing in rural Quebec to the battlefields of Italy, reflects the resilience and dedication of his generation. Though his life was shaped by hardship, he answered his country’s call with courage and determination, embodying the values of duty and selflessness.

Philippe’s memory lives on in the hearts of his family, his community, and the history of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. 
His story reminds us of the immense sacrifices made by so many to secure the freedoms we cherish today, and of the profound impact of those who gave everything for a better future.
