Private Harvey William Hickingbottom, Service Number B64622, served with the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. 
Born on August 24, 1922, in Toronto, Ontario, Harvey grew up as the third child in a family of five. His parents, Joseph Norman and Clara Gertrude Hickingbottom, raised him alongside his siblings, Lloyd Joseph, Thelma, and Maron Lois. His father passed away while Harvey was still young, leaving his mother as the head of the household.

Harvey completed Grade 11 in high school, where he participated in various sports and team games, reflecting his active and outgoing nature. His hobbies and athleticism earned him spots on many school teams, preparing him for the physical demands of military service. Despite having a minor pulmonary condition and vision issues, he was deemed fit for service.

Before enlisting, Harvey held various jobs that demonstrated his resourcefulness and desire to better himself. He worked on an electrical assembly line at Wagner Electric Co., as a clerk in Morgan’s Grocery Store, and in roles assembling sunglasses, telegraph work, and in a butcher shop. Though his employment history included many odd jobs, each role contributed to his growing skills and versatility.

Motivated by a desire for adventure, Harvey enlisted in the Canadian Army on June 24, 1941, in Toronto. He was initially assigned to the Queen’s Own Rifles (Q.O.R.) training wing and later to the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (R.C.O.C.) with the 6th Salvage Unit. His commanders noted his cooperative attitude and solid work ethic. Despite being shy and reserved, Harvey was known for his dependability and ability to adapt to various assignments.

Harvey embarked for the United Kingdom on November 12, 1941, where he spent over three years preparing for operational duties. His military training included exposure to mechanical work, a field he hoped to pursue further. 
By December 1944, he was transferred to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards and deployed to Italy during the Italian Campaign.

On January 13, 1945, just a month after arriving in Italy, Private Hickingbottom was killed in action. He was 22 years old. He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where his grave in Plot I, Row B, Grave 3 honors his sacrifice.

Private Harvey William Hickingbottom’s life was marked by resilience, hard work, and a commitment to service. From his early days in Toronto to the battlefields of Italy, Harvey displayed quiet determination and a willingness to take on new challenges. 
His legacy serves as a reminder of the courage and dedication of those who gave their lives in service to their country.
