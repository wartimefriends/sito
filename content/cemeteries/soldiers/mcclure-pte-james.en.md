title = "Private James Kenneth McCLURE was born on May 15, 1920, in Norville, Ontario. Growing up as the eldest of three boys, he faced early challenges, with his father, William Alexander, passing away when James was only 15 months old. Raised by his mother, Edna, in Sarnia, Ontario, James had two brothers: Donald Leonard, who was later killed in Sicily in 1943, and John William Alex. He also had a half-brother, Edward Leland Ivinson, who served with the U.S. Navy."

James’s early education took him to Grade 8, with a brief period in Grade 9. Although he had high scholastic potential, he left school due to a lack of interest in studies. Afterward, he spent five years farming, eventually managing a 200-acre farm for two years. In search of better financial prospects, he worked as a deckhand on a Great Lakes freight boat with Canada Steamship Lines, with plans to return to farming someday.

On January 13, 1942, James enlisted in the Canadian Army in London, Ontario. Initially joining as part of the Royal Canadian Artillery, he underwent basic training and later advanced training in artillery and anti-aircraft operations. He served in several postings, including the 22nd Anti-Aircraft Regiment, before being reallocated to the Canadian Infantry Corps for further training. 
By mid-1944, James was eager to go overseas, expressing a willingness to serve and no hesitation about the emotional hardships that lay ahead. He was described as stocky and good-humored, with a straightforward outlook and satisfactory social skills, and he was seen as capable of taking on non-technical specialist roles in the infantry.

In July 1944, James was posted to the Perth Regiment, and his journey took him from Canada to the United Kingdom and then to the battlefields of Italy. 
By that time, James had already experienced personal loss with the death of his younger brother Donald in the Sicilian campaign. Despite this, he remained focused and driven in his service, showcasing his willingness and positive attitude.

During his time in Italy, James faced the harsh realities of combat. 
On December 13, 1944, at the age of 24, he was killed in action.at the Naviglio Canal at Villa Prati, Bagnacavallo
 His sacrifice left an indelible mark on his family. His wife, Norma Louise Gehm, originally from Wilcox, Saskatchewan, was left widowed and would give birth to their daughter, Carol Louise, on February 13, 1945, two months after James’s death.

Private McClure’s memory is honored at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot VII A 10. 
His story is one of quiet determination and commitment, a young man from rural Ontario who, despite his modest ambitions and simple outlook, answered the call of duty and paid the ultimate price. His family, particularly his wife and posthumous daughter, Carol, carry forward his legacy, remembering the sacrifices he made.
