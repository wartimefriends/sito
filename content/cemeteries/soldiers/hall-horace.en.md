The story of Gunner Horace Hall is one of resilience, quiet determination, and sacrifice, reflecting the life of a young man who answered the call to serve his country during a tumultuous time. 
Born on July 25, 1920, in Toronto, Ontario, Horace was the youngest of seven children in a family shaped by hardship. His parents, Horace Sr. and Annie (Harber), raised him alongside his brothers, William, George, and Albert, and his sisters, Annie, Lillian, and Ida. Tragedy marked his early years: his father passed away when Horace was just nine years old, and his older sisters stepped in to help raise him.

Despite these challenges, Horace’s childhood was marked by curiosity and an industrious spirit. He completed grade eight and developed hobbies such as stamp collecting and building model airplanes. Active in sports, he enjoyed fishing, hunting, and swimming, and played hockey and lacrosse as a left winger, as well as softball as a baserunner. These pastimes showcased a lively and determined young man with a zest for life.

Horace began working at an early age to support himself, taking on a variety of jobs that highlighted his versatility and strong work ethic. From 1937 to 1939, he worked as a sheet metal worker in Scarborough, earning $12.50 a week for his brother-in-law’s business, W. Wallace. He later became an ornamental iron worker, earning $18.00 a week for Cooper Bros. and Wilson. 
Though he also briefly worked in the rubber industry, his passion for hands-on craftsmanship remained evident throughout his employment history.

Standing at 5’4½” and weighing 126 pounds, Horace was described as healthy, personable, and eager to succeed. He bore scars on his left leg and right cheek from burns sustained in an accident in December 1941 but remained optimistic about his health. 
While his heart was initially set on joining the navy, circumstances led him to enlist in the Royal Canadian Army on January 20, 1942, in North Bay, Ontario. He joined the No. 22 (Basic) Training Centre of the Canadian Army, and in March 1943, was assigned to the 17th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery.

Horace’s military service began in Canada, where he completed basic training before being deployed to the United Kingdom in May 1942. There, he prepared for the challenges of combat. 
By October 1943, Horace was sent to Italy, joining the Allied effort in the Italian Campaign. The campaign was grueling, marked by intense combat as Allied forces fought to push German troops out of Italy.

Tragically, on December 28, 1944, Horace Hall was killed in action during operations in Italy at the age of 24. 
He was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he lies in plot III C 8. His grave stands as a testament to his courage and the ultimate sacrifice he made for his country.

This morning the one of the Gunners of the 60th Battery while looking over the ground in front f the Battery area found the bodies of 4 P.L.D.Gs and recognized one as the brother of Gnr. Bourget of the 60th Battery. The bodies  were taken to 5 Cdn Armd Div Cemetery at Villanova, and burial took place that afternoon. In the late afternoon between 17 and 18 hrs. the enemy laid down a heavy concentration on the 60th Battery area around the Command Post. Gnr. J.A. Greer was wounded, a fragment penetrating the back of the neck, but his wound not considered critical. Telephone lines were cut by the shelling and when fire ceased Gnr. H. Hall and Gnr. J.J. Bachman went to repair the lines. While doing this another shell came over, going through a Quad and exploding close to Gnr. Hall and Gnd. Bachman. Gnd. Hall, H., was dead on his arrival at the C.C.P.
