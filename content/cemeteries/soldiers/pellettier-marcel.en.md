Growing up in a rural area, Marcel attended school up to the second grade. The distance to the school made regular attendance challenging, and he eventually left education, leading to illiteracy. Despite this, he was fluent in both French and English, reflecting the bilingual nature of his community.

From 1933 to 1940, Marcel worked as a woodsman (chopper) for W.H. Miller in Campbellton, New Brunswick, earning a weekly salary of $17. His experience in the woods honed his physical strength and endurance. Standing at 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 138 pounds, he had brown eyes, light brown hair, and a clear complexion. Known for his pleasant manner and happy-go-lucky attitude, he was considered a useful man, though occasionally a bit careless. 
Marcel hoped to continue working as a woodsman after the war.

Driven by a sense of duty, he enlisted in the Canadian Army on August 15, 1940, in Quebec. Marcel joined the Royal Rifles of Canada (C.A.S.F.) as a rifleman, expressing a desire to serve in this capacity. His military records indicate service in Canada until he was taken on strength by the Perth Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps (R.C.I.C.) in March 1944. He was then deployed to the Italian theatre, participating in significant military operations during World War II.

Tragically, Private Marcel Pelletier died of wounds received in action on January 4, 1945, at the age of 26. 
His sacrifice is commemorated at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests at Plot II, Row C, Grave 5. His dedication and service remain a proud part of his family’s legacy and Canada’s military history.

Remembered for his cheerful demeanor and commitment to duty, Private Pelletier exemplified the bravery of those who served during World War II. His story highlights the contributions of individuals who, despite personal challenges, stood up to fulfill their duty in the face of global conflict.
