#### Perth Regiment, R.C.I.C.
<br>


René J. LACASSE, a member of the Perth Regiment, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, was a man of dedication and resilience who served his country with honor during World War II.

Born on June 21, 1913, in Ottawa, Ontario, René grew up in a large and close-knit family, with three brothers—Henri, Leo, and Fernand—and four sisters: Blanche, Lucille, Alice, and Jeannette. His father, Nelson, passed away in 1941, and his mother, Rose, remained a steady presence for the family. René was the fourth child and embraced his role within the family with quiet responsibility.

René completed his education up to Grade 7 before leaving school at the age of 15 to support his family. Known for his cooperative nature and ambition, he was bilingual, speaking both English and French, which served him well in his professional life. 
Before enlisting, René worked as a truck and transport driver, primarily for Oscar Villeneuve in Ottawa, and later as a laborer with the Waterworks Department, laying pipes and drilling. His reliable work ethic earned him a promise of reemployment post-war, and he looked forward to returning to work as he also dreamed of one day becoming an electrical engineer.

On June 28, 1940, René enlisted in the Canadian Army in Ottawa, driven by a desire for a change and a sense of duty to his country. He was initially assigned to the Governor General’s Foot Guards before transferring to the Perth Regiment in September 1941. His military service took him through various assignments, including qualifying as a Class III Driver and later training as a shoemaker. 
René’s sturdy frame—standing 5 feet 7 ½ inches tall, with blue eyes and light brown hair—fit well with the physical demands of military life, and his superiors described him as ambitious and cooperative.

René was deployed to the United Kingdom in October 1941, where he prepared for overseas operations. In October 1943, he joined the Italian Campaign, where the Perth Regiment faced some of the most challenging battles of the war. Known for his steady character, René took on his role with quiet determination, contributing to the Allied efforts with dedication and resilience.

Outside of his duties, René had a range of interests that reflected his active lifestyle. He enjoyed hunting, bowling, and swimming, and he participated in team sports, notably softball, where he played as a catcher. His mechanical hobbies aligned with his practical skills, and he was well-regarded by his peers for his positive attitude and hardworking nature.

René was married to Lucille, with whom he shared both joy and sorrow. 
Together, they had a son, Gerald, and tragically lost two young daughters, Jeannine, who passed away at the age of two, and Alice, who died as an infant. Despite the hardships, René remained devoted to his family, carrying their memory with him throughout his service.

Tragically, Private René J. Lacasse was killed in action on December 20, 1944, while serving in Italy at the Fosso Munio at Villa Prati, Bagnacavallo. 
His loss was deeply felt by his family and his community in Ottawa. He was laid to rest at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot IV, Row A, Grave 10, a resting place shared with fellow soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice.

René’s memory endures as a testament to the quiet heroism of men who served with steadfast courage. His story is a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who left their families and futures behind to serve, embodying a commitment that continues to inspire.
