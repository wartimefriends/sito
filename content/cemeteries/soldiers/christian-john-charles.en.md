Private John Charles Christian was born on August 9, 1920, in Indako, British Columbia. The youngest of three children, he was raised in Strawberry Hill, New Westminster, BC, by his parents, Charles Henry and Annie Christian, alongside his two older sisters, Annie Marie (Dobson) and Helen Louise (Bright). 
John’s childhood was described as happy, filled with outdoor activities and close family bonds.

John attended school up to Grade 9 before entering the workforce to contribute to his family’s livelihood. His early employment was tied to British Columbia’s fishing industry, where he worked at the St. Mungo Cannery in Ladner, earning $20 per week during seasonal work. 
John’s interests and ambitions reflected his practical nature: he dreamed of becoming a welder after the war and enjoyed hobbies such as building model airplanes. Active and athletic, John participated in sports including swimming, skiing, soccer, and lacrosse, where he played as a left wing.

Standing 5’9½” tall and weighing 150 pounds, John was a healthy, strong young man with brown eyes, brown hair, and a medium complexion. Described as active and assertive, he was also recognized for his steady disposition and satisfactory mechanical aptitude, making him well-suited for military service.

Driven by a sense of duty and a thirst for adventure, John enlisted in the Canadian Army on May 24, 1940, in Calgary, Alberta. 
Initially joining the Royal Canadian Artillery for training in anti-tank operations, he was later reassigned to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment in November 1944.

John’s military journey began in Canada, where he trained for six months before deploying to the United Kingdom in December 1940. Over the next three years, he honed his skills in preparation for combat. 
In October 1943, he joined the Italian Campaign, one of the most arduous theaters of the Second World War. The campaign tested every soldier’s courage and endurance as they battled through harsh conditions and unyielding enemy resistance.

Despite the challenges, John served with determination and resilience. His role in the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment placed him on the front lines of the Allied effort to liberate Italy.

On December 14, 1944, during intense combat near Villa  Prati, Italy, John was killed in action. He was just 21 years old.

Private John Charles Christian was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot VI, Row A, Grave 7. His grave serves as a solemn tribute to his service and sacrifice.

John’s story is one of a young man who sought adventure but found himself in the crucible of war. 
From the quiet shores of British Columbia to the battlefields of Italy, his life exemplifies the courage, resilience, and sense of duty that defined his generation.

Though his time was brief, John’s memory endures in the hearts of his family, his community, and the history of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. 
His sacrifice reminds us of the extraordinary contributions made by ordinary men and women who gave everything to secure the freedoms we cherish today.

Elio Minguzzi from Villanova, to honor the Canadians soldiers who fought for our freedom chose, also for his second newborn, the name of one of the heroes who rest in the Villanova War Cemetery: - Christian – after John Charles Cristian
