title = "Private Kenneth Gordon STEPHENS was born on January 27, 1925, in Windsor, Ontario. The youngest of four brothers, Kenneth grew up in a close-knit family, with his parents William James and Virginia Dorothy Stephens, and his brothers Harold, Ralph, and Robert. His childhood was marked by the normalcy of farm life and rural Windsor, where he contributed by helping on the family farm and working in his father’s boat livery business."

Kenneth left school at the age of 16 after completing Grade VII, followed by six months of vocational education at Junior Windsor Vocational School. He was a young man of modest means, working as a truck helper for Buy-Rite Furniture Co. for about a year. With an active interest in sports, Kenneth excelled in boxing, fishing, and hockey, playing as a goalie. In his spare time, he enjoyed singing as a tenor, hinting at his love for music.

When World War II called for more men to enlist, Kenneth was ready to answer. He joined the army on February 23, 1943, motivated by a simple yet profound reason: “Just wanted to be in it.” His commitment to serve was born out of a sense of duty and a desire to join his two brothers, who were already in the “R” Army. He trained in Canada until mid-February 1944 before being sent to the UK. By March of that year, he found himself deployed in Italy, fighting alongside the Perth Regiment, R.C.I.C.

Despite his limited formal education, Kenneth quickly adapted to military life. He displayed a good attitude and a keen willingness to learn. Described as friendly, keen, and alert, Kenneth embodied the qualities of a good soldier. His army assessments depicted him as a “smart soldier” with a friendly disposition, although his small build, standing 5’6” and weighing 147 lbs, did not deter his enthusiasm.

Tragically, Kenneth’s military service was cut short on December 20, 1944, when he was killed in action in Italy during the brutal fighting that defined the later stages of the Italian Campaign. 
He was just 19 years old. Private Stephens now rests at Villanova War Cemetery, IV-C-9, a testament to his service and sacrifice alongside his comrades. Though young, Kenneth left behind a legacy of dedication, remembered with pride by his family and fellow soldiers.
