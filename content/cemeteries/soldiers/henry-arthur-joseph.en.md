Arthur Joseph Henry’s life and sacrifice tell the story of a dedicated soldier who left behind a humble life in Chatham Head, New Brunswick, to serve his country during one of the most challenging periods in history. 
Born on November 2, 1921, Arthur was raised in a modest home by his mother, Mary, after the passing of his father. Alongside his brothers, Edmond and Leonard, and sisters, Kathleen and Margarite, Arthur grew up in a close-knit family that valued hard work and perseverance.

Arthur’s early years were defined by simplicity and labor. After completing grade six, he began working in a wood mill and woods operations in Blackville, New Brunswick. Despite limited educational opportunities, Arthur aspired to learn a trade, expressing a particular interest in becoming a motor mechanic. Standing 5’6” tall and weighing 127 pounds, with blue eyes, brown hair, and a medium complexion, Arthur was a determined and capable young man.

On June 5, 1941, at the age of 19, Arthur enlisted in the Canadian Army in Newcastle, New Brunswick. His decision to serve came during a time when the world was embroiled in the Second World War, and Canada was calling upon its young men to join the fight for freedom. Initially assigned to the 1st Battalion of the North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment, Arthur embarked on his military journey, which would take him far from home.

Arthur’s training and service began in Canada, but by July 1941, he had crossed the Atlantic to the United Kingdom, where he spent two years preparing for the challenges ahead. 
In June 1943, he was deployed to Italy, joining the Royal Canadian Regiment (R.C.R.) as part of the Allied effort in the Italian Campaign. This campaign was marked by fierce battles, difficult terrain, and harsh conditions as Allied forces sought to push German troops out of Italy.

Despite the hardships of war, Arthur proved to be a resilient and dedicated soldier. In September 1944, he was wounded in action but chose to remain on duty, a testament to his commitment and bravery. His resolve was emblematic of the courage displayed by countless soldiers who faced unimaginable trials during the war.

Tragically, Arthur’s service came to an end on December 5, 1944, when he was killed by artillery fire along, with Sgt Rudolph Cloutier, during the fighting at Russi.
He was 23 years old. 
Both Henry and Cloutier were initially recorded as “missing-presumed dead.”
The bodies of both men were later buried in a battlefield cemetery in front of Palazzo S. Giacomo - Russi
Then he was re-buried in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, his grave marked at plot I C 3. His final resting place is a solemn reminder of the ultimate sacrifice he made in the fight against tyranny.

Private Arthur Joseph Henry’s journey from a small town in New Brunswick to the battlefields of Italy is a story of selflessness and dedication. His ambition to learn, his love for his family, and his willingness to serve his country paint the picture of a young man who gave everything for a cause greater than himself. 
Arthur’s name is etched in the annals of history and on the hearts of those who remember his sacrifice, standing as a symbol of the valor of his generation.
