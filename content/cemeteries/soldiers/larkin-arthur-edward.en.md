Born on October 22, 1915, in St. Peter’s Bay, Prince Edward Island, Arthur was raised on the family farm by his parents, John Julius and Emma, alongside his five brothers—Francis, Eugene, Joseph Raymond, Dennis Philip, and Patrick Herbert—and his sister, Victoria Catherine. Growing up on a farm, he developed a strong work ethic and a connection to the land, working for the same employer for ten years before joining the army.

Arthur completed Grade 10, which provided him with foundational knowledge that would serve him throughout his life. Although farming was his primary occupation, he held ambitions of working as a clerk, suggesting a desire to explore opportunities beyond agriculture. Tall and lean, Arthur stood 5 feet 9 inches tall, with light brown hair, blue eyes, and a medium complexion. His quiet demeanor and steady nature made him a respected figure within his family and community.

On July 15, 1940, at the age of 24, Arthur enlisted in the Canadian Army in Charlottetown, PEI, joining the P.E.I. Highlanders. With the outbreak of World War II, Arthur felt a strong sense of duty to his country, which led him to leave his rural life and serve in the military. His training initially took him through various locations in Canada, including Halifax, Valcartier, Gander, and Sussex, where he honed the skills necessary for his role as an infantryman. By the summer of 1943, Arthur was posted to the United Kingdom, where he prepared for the European campaigns ahead.

In February 1944, Arthur was deployed to Italy with the Cape Breton Highlanders, joining the Allied forces in the grueling Italian Campaign. The battles there were marked by fierce resistance and challenging conditions, but Arthur’s determination and resilience saw him through. As a soldier, he adapted to the harsh realities of war, facing each day with the quiet strength that had defined him throughout his life.

Arthur’s mother, Emma, remained a steady presence from afar, supporting her son’s service with a sense of pride and sacrifice. After Arthur’s passing, she even requested that his personal clothing be donated for the benefit of other army personnel overseas, a gesture that underscored the family’s deep commitment to the war effort.

Tragically, Private Arthur Edward Larkin was killed in action on December 13, 1944, at the age of 29. 
His loss left a void for his family and community, who mourned the passing of a dedicated son, brother, and soldier. Arthur was laid to rest at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot VII, Row B, Grave 2. His final resting place honors his life and his sacrifice, commemorating his courage and dedication to his country.

Private Arthur Larkin’s legacy lives on as a testament to the sacrifices made by countless young men who left behind family, friends, and familiar landscapes to fight for a better world. 
His story is a reminder of the quiet heroism and unwavering resolve that defined so many soldiers who served in World War II.
