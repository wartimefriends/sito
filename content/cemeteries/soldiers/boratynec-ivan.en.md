Sergeant Ivan Boratynec was born on June 18, 1917, in Mannville, Alberta, the third child in a family of four. His early life was marked by resilience and determination, traits that would define him throughout his years. Ivan’s childhood was shaped by hardship; he lost his mother when he was just eight years old, leaving his father, Joseph, to care for Ivan and his three sisters: Annie, Mary, and Jessie.

Ivan grew up in Vermilion, Alberta, where he attended school until the age of 15, completing Grade 9. After leaving school, he embarked on an apprenticeship as an auto mechanic, a trade he pursued with dedication for four years. Though he did not complete the formal apprenticeship, Ivan gained valuable hands-on experience, which became the foundation of his future work. 
From 1935 to 1938, Ivan worked at a flour mill during the winters, sacking flour, while honing his mechanical skills during the summers. 
By 1938, he was employed as an auto mechanic for Mr. George Law, a position he hoped to return to after the war.

Ivan’s hobbies reflected his love for mechanics, as well as a passion for sports. He enjoyed boxing, hunting, hockey, and baseball, displaying a competitive spirit and physical prowess. Standing 6’1” and weighing 175 pounds, with brown eyes and a cheerful demeanor, Ivan was both approachable and dependable. His cooperative nature and knack for problem-solving made him a valued member of any team, whether at work or in his personal life.

On December 13, 1939, Ivan enlisted in the Canadian military in Edmonton, Alberta, joining the Edmonton Regiment at the outset of World War II. 
Like many young men of his time, he viewed military service as inevitable and approached it with a sense of duty. His aptitude for mechanics and his experience as a driver made him an excellent candidate for specialized training in the military.

After a brief period of service in Canada, Ivan was deployed to the United Kingdom on December 29, 1939. There, he completed courses in driver operation and mechanics, excelling in both. 
His instructors consistently rated his performance as “good,” recognizing his ability to adapt his civilian skills to military applications. Ivan’s strong grasp of map reading and mechanical knowledge made him an asset to his unit.

By June 1943, Ivan was sent to Italy, joining the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (PLDG) of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps (RCIC). The Dragoon Guards were known for their mechanized reconnaissance capabilities, a role that suited Ivan’s talents perfectly. As a driver and mechanic, he ensured the maintenance and functionality of vehicles critical to the regiment’s operations.

Ivan’s time in Italy was defined by the relentless demands of the Allied campaign. He participated in grueling battles across challenging terrain, supporting his regiment through his mechanical expertise and dedication to duty. In September 1944, Ivan was promoted to Lance Sergeant, a testament to his leadership and reliability.

Despite the hardships of war, Ivan remained cheerful and cooperative, traits that boosted the morale of those around him. 
However, like many soldiers, he faced physical challenges, including a bout of cellulitis in his right foot and an occupational psychiatric hospitalization. These setbacks did not deter him from returning to the frontlines.

On December 17, 1944, Ivan was killed in action in Italy at the age of 27. His death came during the final stages of the Italian campaign, as the Allies pushed toward victory. Ivan’s loss was deeply felt by his family, friends, and comrades, who remembered him as a dedicated and skilled soldier who gave everything for his country.

Sergeant Ivan Boratynec’s life was one of quiet determination and selflessness. Born into humble beginnings, he grew into a capable and resourceful young man whose mechanical skills and work ethic served him well both in civilian life and on the battlefield. Though his life was cut short, Ivan’s contributions to the war effort and the sacrifices he made exemplify the courage and resilience of the Canadian soldiers who fought in World War II.

Today, Ivan is remembered not only as a soldier but as a son, a brother, and a man who stepped forward to serve his country in its time of need. 
His story serves as a reminder of the many lives shaped by the war, and of the sacrifices made in the name of freedom.
