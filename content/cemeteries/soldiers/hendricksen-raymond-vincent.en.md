Raymond Vincent Hendricksen’s story is one of dedication, resilience, and sacrifice, spanning from his humble beginnings in Newcastle, New Brunswick, to his service with the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards in Italy. 
Born on October 5, 1921, Raymond grew up in a harmonious family environment with his parents, Cato, a Norwegian sailor, and Charlotte Galliah, and his siblings, Leland John (who tragically passed away in 1940), Mary Veronica, and Florence Teresa Olga.

From a young age, Raymond displayed a strong work ethic and aptitude for hands-on skills. After completing grade eight and the first year of high school in an English school in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, he became a welder. He apprenticed for three years and eventually became self-employed, mastering both acetylene and electric welding. His ambition to excel in his trade was evident, and he planned to return to welding after his military service.

Standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 185 pounds, Raymond had a commanding presence. He was neat, cooperative, and described as having a pleasant disposition. In addition to his professional ambitions, he was a devoted family man. Married to Jean Margaret Rowand Prentice on May 15, 1941, he was the proud father of two daughters, Mildred Jean and Barbara-Anne, the latter born on August 14, 1943. His family was a central part of his life and provided him with motivation and purpose during his service.

Raymond enlisted in the Canadian Army on September 8, 1942, in Montreal South, Quebec. While he had previously served in the Reserve Force from 1937 to 1939, his call-up in 1942 marked the start of his active military career. Initially assigned to the Royal Montreal Regiment (Machine Gun), Raymond underwent extensive training and demonstrated enthusiasm for advancing his military knowledge, despite initial assessments placing him slightly below average in intelligence and learning ability. His eagerness to learn and his cooperative nature earned him a place in an NCO class, where he honed his leadership skills.

In March 1943, Raymond was deployed to the United Kingdom, where he continued training and preparation for the demanding role of reconnaissance. By June 1943, he was sent to Italy, joining the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, a regiment known for its reconnaissance expertise and involvement in the Italian Campaign.

The Italian Campaign was arduous and marked by fierce combat as Allied forces pushed through challenging terrain to liberate Italy from Axis control. Raymond’s service in Italy was a testament to his resilience and dedication. He faced the hardships of war with courage and determination, contributing to his regiment’s efforts in a critical theater of the Second World War.
“The battle for the Naviglio began after dark on 12 December,1944. It was overcast evening, with a thick mist giving way to drizzle as the troops slogged forward. Four battalions spearheaded the operation. On the right, the Fifth Division sent into action the only two infantry units that had not yet been involved in the fighting, the Princess Louise Dragoons Guards (Plugs) and the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regt.
Ray was listed as “missing in action” and, when his body was found, he was confirmed as “killed in action.”
On December 13, 1944, Raymond was killed in action at the age of 23. 
His sacrifice is commemorated at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he lies at rest in plot V-B-6
His grave, alongside those of his comrades, stands as a solemn reminder of the cost of freedom and the sacrifices made by countless young men during the war.

Corporal Raymond Vincent Hendricksen’s life was defined by his commitment to his family, his craft, and his country. His journey from a skilled welder in Trois-Rivières to a brave soldier in the Italian Campaign highlights his dedication and determination. 
Though his life was cut short, his legacy endures, inspiring future generations to remember the courage and sacrifice of those who served.
