#### Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regt., R.C.I.C.
<br>


Private Roy Joseph Schaffer, a soldier in the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps (R.C.I.C.), served Canada with dedication until his life was tragically taken in action on December 13, 1944, during World War II. He is remembered with honor at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot VII, Row C, Grave 6.

Roy was born on July 25, 1921, in Shaunavon, Saskatchewan. One of fourteen siblings, he was the twelfth child in a large and close-knit family, raised by his mother, Eva, who had been separated from his father, Mark, for seven years by the time of Roy’s passing. Roy’s early life was marked by hardship, both in terms of family loss and in the struggles of daily life on the prairie. His family had faced profound grief, losing three siblings at young ages—Albert as an infant, Leonard at age seven to gangrene after stepping on a nail, and another infant at birth. Through these losses, Eva persevered, raising her children largely on her own.

Growing up, Roy attended school only until Grade 3. His education was limited by the demands of farm work, as he had to help at home and walk ten miles to attend classes. He worked on various farms around Saskatchewan from 1937 to 1940, gaining experience in mixed farming. His strong frame—standing at 5 feet 11 inches and weighing 200 pounds—made him well-suited for labor, and he developed a broad skill set as a farm laborer.

Despite the challenges of his youth, Roy found joy in simple pleasures like swimming and playing baseball, where he was a capable shortstop. Although he was not known to be particularly ambitious, he had hopes for the future: after the war, he wished to return to farming and dreamed of learning mechanics to improve his skill set. He spoke English fluently and knew some conversational German, likely a skill inherited from his family’s roots.

When Roy enlisted in the Canadian Army on May 30, 1940, in Regina, Saskatchewan, he was seeking steady work and a chance to serve. Initially assigned to the 1st Light Anti-Aircraft Battery of the Royal Canadian Artillery, he was later transferred to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment on October 26, 1944. Roy’s service took him to the United Kingdom in August 1940 and eventually to the Italian front in June 1943, where he bravely fought alongside his regiment until his final days.

On December 13, 1944, Roy was killed in action, a loss deeply felt by his family, especially his mother, Eva, who had raised him through years of hardship. She expressed a heartfelt wish to receive his personal belongings, hoping to hold onto the mementoes of her son.

Private Roy Joseph Schaffer’s story is one of resilience, loyalty, and sacrifice. His dedication to his family and to his country exemplifies the quiet heroism of those who served without fanfare, whose dreams and futures were cut short by the war. His legacy endures in the memory of his loved ones and in the peace for which he gave his life.
