title = "Charles Cecil Morley"
+++

Born on April 19, 1921, in Granton, Ontario, Charles Morley grew up in a large, close-knit family in the rural community of Monetville, Ontario. The sixth of eleven children, he was raised by his parents, Oscar and Flossie Morley, who instilled in him a strong work ethic and sense of duty. His father, Oscar, was a veteran of the First World War and a member of the Veterans Guard in the Second World War, reinforcing a legacy of service in the Morley household.

Charles left school at 15 and went to work, developing a wealth of experience as a laborer on various farms in northern Ontario during the summers. During the winters, he worked in logging camps and in the mines for International Nickel in Levack, Ontario. His income, a modest $15 per week, was essential to support his family. Athletic and hardworking, he had dreams of one day learning a trade, particularly as a machinist, which reflected his ambition to improve his skills and provide a stable future for his family.

When several of his friends enlisted, Charles felt the call to serve as well. He joined the Canadian forces on October 3, 1941, in Toronto. During his training in Canada and subsequent deployment to the United Kingdom, he impressed his commanders as an “alert and ambitious” soldier. He was dedicated to improving himself, earning a good conduct record that spoke to his reliability and dedication. He remained in the UK until October 1943, when he was deployed to Italy to join the Allied efforts against Axis forces.

Charles’s commitment to his family remained steadfast throughout his service. His mother received monthly financial support from him and his two other brothers in active service. However, tragedy struck the Morley family just before Christmas in 1944. Only two months earlier, Charles’s younger brother, Arthur Bruce, had also been killed in action. This second blow, so soon after losing Arthur, left an indelible mark on their family, particularly on their mother, Flossie, who struggled with the dual loss.

Charles Morley’s final resting place is marked by a gravestone in Villanova War Cemetery, where he lies in Plot VII, Row C, Grave 9. 
A photograph of his grave was sent to his mother in 1947, offering a bittersweet comfort—a connection to a son who sacrificed everything for his country.


From a local newspaper clipping:

Lance Corporal Charles Cecil Morley, known for his resilience and dedication, served in the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps (R.C.I.C.), until he was killed in action on December 13, 1944. 
Born on April 19, 1921, in Granton, Ontario, Charles spent his childhood in Perth County and later moved with his family to the Nipissing District, Ontario, where they settled in Monetville. His father, Oscar John Morley, a veteran himself, and his mother, Flossie Salome Morley, raised Charles and his ten siblings in a modest but close-knit household.
Charles left school at 15 and quickly took on work as a laborer, developing skills in mixed farming and working as a miner for International Nickel in Levack, Ontario. Known for his strong work ethic, he spent summers farming and winters laboring in mines or logging camps, earning a modest $15 per week. His desire to learn a trade and develop practical skills marked him as an ambitious young man with a promising future.
In October 1941, at 20 years old, Charles enlisted in Toronto, inspired by friends joining up. After training in Canada, he was posted to the United Kingdom in March 1942, where he served with dedication and earned respect for his “alert” and eager disposition. 
By October 1943, Charles was deployed to Italy, where he joined the grueling campaigns of the Italian front.

Charles’s service took a toll on his family, who were already familiar with the hardships of wartime. His younger brother, Arthur Bruce Morley, had been killed in action just two months earlier on October 8, 1944, a devastating loss for their mother, who had also been receiving assigned pay from three sons on active duty. Their father, Oscar, was also a veteran, having served in both the Canadian Expeditionary Force and the Canadian Active Service Force, and was working to rehabilitate himself on a small farm in Monetville.

The Morley family endured difficult times on the home front, with Oscar and Flossie living in a small three-room shack with three younger children. Charles consistently supported his mother by assigning her $20 a month from his military pay, a gesture that demonstrated his sense of responsibility and love for his family. His effects, held in England after his death, were eventually managed by family friends, with personal items returned to his grieving parents.

Lance Corporal Charles Cecil Morley lies at rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, buried close to his fellow soldiers, including Private Robert Ivan Mulligan, who died on the same day. 
Charles’s sacrifice left an indelible mark on his family, who continued to honor his memory. A photograph of his grave was sent to his mother in 1947, a poignant reminder of a young life given in service to his country and the values he held dear.
