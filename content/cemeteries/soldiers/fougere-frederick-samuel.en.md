Frederick Samuel Fougere was born on March 29, 1919, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Samuel and Kathleen Fougere. The second of nine children, Frederick grew up in a large, lively family with two brothers—Thomas J. and William A.—and six sisters: Eileen, Mae, Lola, Kathleen, Elizabeth, and Helen. His upbringing was typical of the time, though marked by modest opportunities and hard work.

Frederick completed Grade V in school, finding little enjoyment in academics, and left to seek work. His early years were filled with various jobs that provided him with practical skills and a sense of independence. From 1935 to 1937, he worked on road construction for a weekly wage of $17, followed by a stint delivering fish for Crook’s Fish Market in Halifax in 1939, earning $8 per week. Frederick also took on odd jobs in Shubenacadie, NS. Though he lacked formal education, Frederick was resourceful and dreamed of becoming a machinist after the war.

Standing 5’6” tall and weighing 150 pounds, Frederick had blue eyes and a sturdy build. He enjoyed traveling, boxing, and baseball, displaying a restless spirit and a love for physical activity. While he was sometimes described as needing discipline and regular training, he thrived in structured environments and had a sharp mind, as evidenced by his performance on intelligence tests.

On September 5, 1939, Frederick joined the Princess Louise Fusiliers (Machine Gun) as part of the Active Militia. Just weeks later, on September 30, 1939, he enlisted in the Canadian Army in Halifax, driven by a desire for adventure and a steady job. His military career spanned multiple theaters of war, beginning with service in Canada, where he trained until October 1942. From there, he was deployed to the United Kingdom, where he served for a year before joining the Italian Campaign in October 1943.

Frederick’s time in the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment was brief but impactful. He transferred to the regiment just three days before his death, on December 10, 1944. As part of the grueling Italian Campaign, his regiment faced relentless combat in harsh terrain, fighting to push back entrenched German forces.

On December 13, 1944, during operations near Villanova, Italy, Private Frederick Samuel Fougere was killed in action. 
He was 25 years old. His death was deeply felt by his family, who had already endured significant challenges during the war.

Frederick was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy. His grave serves as a testament to his sacrifice, courage, and dedication, and stands among those of his comrades who gave their lives in the fight for freedom.

Frederick’s story is one of perseverance and service. From his humble beginnings in Halifax to the battlefields of Italy, he embodied the resilience and determination of his generation. 
Though his life was tragically cut short, the memory of Private Frederick Samuel Fougere lives on as a reminder of the sacrifices made for peace and liberty.
