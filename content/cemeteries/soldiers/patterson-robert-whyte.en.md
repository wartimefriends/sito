Bob attended Avon Public School and the Stratford Collegiate-Vocational Institute, where he was not only a diligent student but also an outstanding athlete. He played hockey, rugby, and basketball for his school teams, participating in the Western Ontario Secondary Schools Association competitions. His passion for sports extended into his adult life, where he remained an active participant in various athletic endeavors.

In civilian life, Bob was associated with the Stratford Brass Company, following in his father’s professional footsteps. He was a member of St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church and took an active role in the Stratford Rotary Club, reflecting his commitment to community service.

Bob’s athletic prowess was well-known in Stratford. He played for the Stratford Indians in 1939, contributing to their victory in the intermediate championship of the Ontario Rugby Football Union. As a versatile player, he excelled as a quarterback and middle secondary defender. He also played in the Stratford Industrial Softball League for the “Ballantyne-Brass” team and was an ardent badminton enthusiast, serving on the executive of the Stratford Badminton and Social Club.

His military career began in August 1940 when he joined the 2nd (Reserve) Battalion of the Perth Regiment as a private. Demonstrating dedication and leadership, Bob took his duties seriously and gradually rose through the ranks. In 1941, he earned his reserve army commission, serving as the commander of Headquarters Company and treasurer of the Officers’ Mess. His commitment to military service led him to enlist for active duty in 1942, which required him to leave his reserve unit.

Bob qualified for his active service commission at the Canadian Officers’ Training Centre in Gordon Head, British Columbia. Upon returning to Ontario, he was stationed at No. 6 Basic Training Centre in Stratford and later at Camp Ipperwash. In November 1943, he was deployed to Britain and subsequently joined the 1st Active Battalion of the Perth Regiment as a reinforcement officer.

Lieutenant Patterson arrived in Italy as part of the Italian Campaign, a critical series of Allied operations during World War II. Known for his personable nature, he was beloved by the men of his platoon. He took a personal interest in the welfare of each soldier, striving to know them individually and earning their respect and admiration.

Tragically, on December 20, 1944, Lieutenant Robert Whyte Patterson was killed in action while leading his men across the Fosso Munio at Villa Prati, Bagnacavallo, Italy. His death was a significant loss to his family, his regiment, and the Stratford community. News of his passing reached his wife, the former Miss Beatrice Cameron, while she was visiting her parents, Rev. and Mrs. Dallas Cameron, in Detroit. Besides his wife and mother, Bob was survived by his sister Phyllis (Mrs. H. C. Watson) and two brothers: Sergeant Thomas Patterson of the Canadian Army Dental Corps, serving overseas, and Donald Patterson, who was at home.

Lieutenant Patterson’s legacy is one of courage, leadership, and dedication both on the battlefield and in his community. His life exemplified the qualities of a true leader—committed to his duties, compassionate towards his men, and actively involved in bettering his community through sports and service. He is remembered with honor and respect, a testament to the profound impact he had on all who knew him.

Remembered for his bravery and selflessness, Lieutenant Patterson’s story is emblematic of the many young Canadians who sacrificed their lives during World War II. His commitment to his country and his men continues to inspire, serving as a poignant reminder of the cost of freedom and the enduring legacy of those who have served.
