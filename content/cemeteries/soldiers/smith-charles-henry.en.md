Charles Henry Smith was born on October 22, 1916, in Toronto, Ontario. A devoted family man, Charles was married to Eva, and together they had two children, Ethel and Bernice. He came from a large family, which included his father, Charles; two brothers, Kenneth and Robert; and eight sisters: May, Dorothy, Margaret, Mrs. Jean Palmer, Mrs. Florence McNeil, Audrey, Marjorie, and Teresa. Tragically, Charles lost his mother at a young age; she passed away when he was just 11 years old. This loss contributed to a challenging childhood, as the family structure was disrupted.

At the age of 13, Charles left school to help support his family. Throughout his life, he worked as a salesman in Toronto and spent a decade as a concession agent for fairs, running his own business. After the war, he hoped to return to this profession, showing his strong commitment to family tradition and a sense of duty.

Charles enlisted in the Canadian Army on February 20, 1940, in Toronto. He joined the 2nd Field Company of the Royal Canadian Engineers, motivated by the legacy of service in his family. His training began in Canada, where he served until May 12, 1940. He then moved to the United Kingdom, where he served from May 13, 1940, until October 26, 1943. Finally, he was deployed to Italy, arriving on October 27, 1943, where he would serve until his untimely death.

Despite his unremarkable military knowledge and skills in map reading, Charles was known for his determination to improve. He believed all soldiers should receive practical instruction in disease prevention, particularly in relation to venereal diseases, reflecting his sense of responsibility and concern for the welfare of his fellow soldiers. His height was 5 feet 8 inches, and he weighed 168 pounds, with blue eyes and an average disposition.

Unfortunately, Charles’s time in the military was marred by disciplinary issues. He faced numerous punishments for being absent without leave (AWOL) and was even disciplined for petty theft, indicating the stress and worry he felt about his wife’s faithfulness during his absence.

On November 3, 1944, Charles was killed in action while serving with the Porter Force in Italy. He was initially buried in the field by Captain G.E. Eldridge of the 12 Canadian Field Company, Royal Canadian Engineers. In August 1946, his remains were reburied in Villanova War Cemetery, in plot I C 6.

Private Charles Henry Smith’s life was marked by duty, resilience, and the desire to provide for his family. His service and sacrifice in World War II reflect the values of his generation and the profound impact of war on the lives of those left behind. Charles’s legacy lives on through his family and the memories of his commitment to his country and loved ones.
