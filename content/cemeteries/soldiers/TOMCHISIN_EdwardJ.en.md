Private Edward Joseph T(H)OMCHISHIN, service number B/143468, was born on June 22, 1924, in Oakburn, Manitoba. He was 20 years old when he was killed in action on January 4, 1945, in the area of San Alberto. 
Edward was serving with “B” Company of the Irish Regiment of Canada in Italy at the time of his death. 
He is now laid to rest in the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot I, Row A, Grave 6.
Edward grew up in a large, close-knit family. He was the fifth of seven children born to his parents, Michael and Mary Thomchishin. He had three brothers—Bernard, James, and Alfred—and three sisters—Caroline, Francis, and Anne. His family had relocated from Oakburn to Toronto when Edward was just two years old.  
His brother Bernard, who was serving with the 2nd Survey Regiment of the Royal Canadian Engineers, died of wounds on July 27, 1944. Another brother, Alfred, was also serving overseas in the Royal Canadian Engineers in Italy.

Standing 5 feet 7¾ inches tall and weighing 144 pounds, Edward had a fair complexion, brown eyes, and fair hair. His friendly and energetic personality, along with his quick thinking and sharp learning ability, made a strong impression during his military interview. Described as a spirited and well-adjusted young man, Edward had a happy disposition and a social nature. He was particularly fond of social activities but also enjoyed playing hockey in his spare time.

Before joining the army, Edward completed his education up to Grade 8 and worked as a baker’s helper for the Purity Bread Company in Toronto for two and a half years. When he enlisted on March 2, 1943, in Toronto, Ontario, he was eager to follow in the footsteps of his brothers who were already serving in the military. Edward’s enthusiasm for the army was evident—he was glad to be wearing the uniform and was particularly keen on joining the Toronto Scottish Regiment, although he was eventually assigned to the Irish Regiment of Canada.

After completing his basic training in Canada, Edward was sent overseas, first to the United Kingdom on December 15, 1943, and then to Italy, where he arrived on February 15, 1944. He was promoted to Lance Corporal on November 9, 1944, but voluntarily reverted to the rank of Private on December 20, 1944. Despite his youth—he had just turned 19 at the time of his enlistment—Edward was seen as mature, independent, and stable. He was expected to develop into a highly efficient soldier.

Private Thomchishin’s time in the military was tragically short. On January 4, 1945, during the fighting around the town of San Alberto, Italy, Edward was killed in action as his company prepared to engage an enemy counter-attack. His death, like that of his brother Bernard, was a tremendous loss to his family and his country.
On that day, with Tomchisin also Capt. WB SPAFFORD, Sgt WC STEPHENSON (MM) and Lt. KW HARE lost their lives, killed in action

Edward Joseph Thomchishin’s sacrifice, along with that of countless others, played a vital role in the liberation of Europe during World War II. His memory endures in the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, where he rests among his fellow soldiers.
