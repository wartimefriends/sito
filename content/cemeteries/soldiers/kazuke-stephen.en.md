<br>


Stephen Kazuke was born on June 24, 1924, in Lachine, Quebec, the fourth of eight children in a hardworking family. His parents, Nick and Mary Kazuke, were immigrants from Russia who instilled strong values of perseverance and dedication in their children. Stephen’s early years were shaped by the loss of his mother, who passed away five years before his enlistment due to complications from rheumatism. Raised Presbyterian, Stephen grew up in a modest home, supported by his father and stepmother, Mary Sharko.

Stephen attended school in the Montreal suburbs from the age of six to fourteen, completing Grade 7. Despite average marks, he had steady attendance and showed promise. However, financial constraints forced him to leave school to help support the family. He spoke both Ukrainian and English and found enjoyment in basketball and golf, even working as a caddy and cleaning golf clubs during the summer of 1943. Despite his shy and reticent demeanor, Stephen had a pleasant and neat appearance, and his instructors noted his potential to be a capable and disciplined soldier.

Before his military career, Stephen worked a variety of jobs that reflected his resourcefulness and adaptability. He spent nine months as a laminator in a tin foil plant, earning $0.25 per hour, and later worked as an apprentice welder at Dominion Bridge Co. in Lachine, earning $32.00 per week. His aspiration to continue welding after the war underscored his drive to build a stable career. Other roles included laboring at Kruger Paper Co. in Montreal and returning to the laminating plant before government contracts ended.

At 19 years old, standing 5’8¼” and weighing 134 pounds, Stephen enlisted in the Canadian Army on September 28, 1943, in St. Johns, Quebec. His desire to join his three brothers, two of whom were already serving overseas, motivated his enlistment. He initially served with the #4 District Depot in Montreal and later at the Basic Training Centre (BTC) in St. Johns. There, his performance earned him selection for the Commanding Officer’s Guards—a testament to his discipline and excellence during training.

Stephen was keen to pursue specialized roles in the military, volunteering for the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve (R.C.N.V.R.) and later the Parachute Battalion. However, he was deemed unsuitable for parachute training due to a low “M” score, a standard measuring suitability for the rigorous demands of airborne service. Undeterred, he was allocated to infantry training, where he excelled and showed promise as a rifleman.

His journey took him through multiple training centers, including Farnham, Quebec, and Windsor, Nova Scotia. On April 5, 1944, he was deployed to the United Kingdom, continuing his preparation for active duty. By May, Stephen was in Italy, joining the Canadian Military Forces (CMF) as part of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI). He initially served with the 48th Highlanders of Canada before transferring to the 1st Light Anti-Aircraft Battalion in July 1944. By October, he was reassigned to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, where he faced the brutal realities of the Italian Campaign.

The campaign was grueling, marked by relentless combat and challenging conditions. Stephen’s dedication to duty and willingness to serve alongside his brothers made him an integral part of the regiment. However, his service was tragically cut short on January 2, 1945, when he was killed in action. He was just 20 years old.

Private Stephen Kazuke was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot II, Row A, Grave 4. His sacrifice, along with those of countless others, is a solemn reminder of the cost of war and the bravery of those who answered the call to serve. Though his life was brief, his dedication, humility, and sense of duty continue to inspire and honor his memory.

Stephen Kazuke was born at 477- 6th Ave. in Lachine, Quebec, Canada in 1923. Both of his parents immigrated from Austria in 1914. They were both Ukrainian. Stephen’s mother, Annie Baskevitch, was born in 1896 and married Nicholas Kaziuka in 1916 in Lachine, Canada. Nicholas and Annie owned their duplex on 6th Ave. in Lachine. I can remember that there were two lots and in the lot beside the house there were chickens, a rooster and a pig. Food to eat! Feathers for pillows and comforters. The house still stands there. Annie passed away in 1938 giving birth to Stephen’s brother, John (still living, turned 70 on May 27, 2008). 
Stephen had seven bothers: Joseph (1917-1917), Dmytro (1920-1921), Bill (Vasil in Ukrainian d.1980), Mike (d.1990), Peter (Dmytro in Ukrainian, 1922-2000), Fred (1927- 2002), John (b.1938- ) and 2 sisters: Helen (d.1998), Mary (Fred’s twin sister, d.2008). 
Stephen’s father immediately remarried when Annie passed away because he needed someone to take care of his large family. Nick was a labourer. He worked hard & played there. My father told me stories of how they used to only go to school once every four days because they had to share a pair of shoes. John left elementary school (probably grade 3 or 4) as he could not read or right. At that time there was no remedial intervention. The boys used to make extra money by picking up golf balls at the local golf courses or caddying for members. They were all avid golf players in their adult lives. 
All the Kazuke’s did fairly well in life. They had good work ethics. Believed in owning property and never asked for handouts.
… 
Although I have no intimate stories about my Uncle Stephen, I consider him a Hero! I thank him and all his companions for each day that I am able to wake up in this wonderful world of ours. I also thank the people of Villanova, Italy for keeping his and all other’s memories alive. 

Letter written to Pte Stephen Kazuke by a Canadian student visiting the War Cemetery with his kockey team in April 2009

Dear Stephen:
My name is Stevie, I am 17 years old and I live in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Although I never met you nor have I met anyone who knew you, I can tell that you were a good person because you were willing to sacrifice your life for the greater good of mankind. I greatly appreciate what you did so that future generations can enjoy a world with peace, and I believe that although most people in the world do not know your name or who you were, that they are very grateful for the sacrifices you made for us.
I imagine there must have been times when you just wanted to give up and quit fighting. I bet there were other times when you daydreamed about playing golf back in your hometown of Lachine, Quebec. But then reality would set in and you would realize you were laying in a slit trench in a strange country on a different continent trying not to get shot up by an enemy sniper.
My grandfather is a Canadian veteran of World War II. He just turned 85 years old which would put him about 6 months older than you. Grandpa was a small arms instructor with the rank of Sergeant who trained soldiers just like you back in Canada and in the UK. Lucky for me he never saw any action, because brave soldiers like you ended the war while he was still in England. Who knows, if the war hadn't ended when it did, my grandpa may have died in action just like you and I wouldn't be here today to write you this letter.
Stephen, you are an inspiration to my generation. You didn't have to become a soldier, but you felt it was your duty to fight for your country. Thank you for your strength, your courage and your desire to make a difference. Yours was the ultimate sacrifice.
Sincerely,

Stevie England
