George Henry Stacey was born on December 10, 1919, in Dover Township, Ontario. He grew up as the eldest of three children, with two younger brothers, Percy Garnet, who served in the Merchant Marine and Arthur Roy. His parents, Roy Hall and Hilda Ella, separated in 1935 when George was still a young teenager.

At the age of 13, George left school, explaining that he was “fed up” with formal education. Despite his early departure from school, he remained active in sports, excelling in skating, swimming, soccer (where he played in defense), and softball, playing shortstop. He had a practical approach to work, taking up jobs as a laborer for building contractors, working in construction, painting, and occasionally farming in the Chatham, Ontario area. He dreamed of one day running a small restaurant or working as an automotive mechanic after the war.

Standing 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 162 pounds, and with blue eyes and a cheerful disposition, George was known for being cooperative and reliable. His superiors described him as neat in appearance, healthy, and with a friendly, upbeat attitude. He enjoyed his role in the military and got along well with his fellow soldiers. He was seen as an excellent candidate for roles such as a Bren gunner or general duties.

George enlisted in the Canadian Army on December 1, 1939, at the age of seventeen in London, Ontario, with the Royal Canadian Regiment. His military career began with a brief stint in the Kent Regiment from February to November 1939. He enlisted not only out of an interest in the army but also out of a desire for excitement. He served in Canada briefly and, within two week from his enlistment, he was on his way overseas being posted to the United Kingdom on December 19, 1939.

After several years of service in the U.K., he was transferred to Italy on June 29, 1943, during the height of the Italian Campaign of World War II. In September 1944, George was reassigned to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards.

Private Stacey’s service took him through some of the most difficult battles of the Italian Campaign, a grueling and bloody series of operations aimed at liberating Italy from Axis control. Wounded in the knee on September 1943, during the campaign in Sicily, he quickly recovered and within two weeks was back in his Unit. Despite the hardships, George continued to serve with dedication and distinction.

Tragically, on December 17, 1944, George Henry Stacey was killed in action during the fighting between the Naviglio Canal and the Fosso Munio. 
He was only 25 years old. 
He is buried at Villanova War Cemetery, V B 1, where his memory lives on, alongside countless other soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice.
His name and story are a lasting testament to his bravery, dedication, and selfless service during one of the most challenging chapters of the Second World War.
