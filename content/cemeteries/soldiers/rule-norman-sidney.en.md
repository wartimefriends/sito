Norman Sidney RULE was born on November 25, 1923, in Montreal, Quebec, to Frederick George and Rose Rule (née Fletcher). Growing up in North Montreal, Norman lived with his parents and siblings, his brother George and his sister Rose. His early years were marked by a love for sports like hockey and baseball, a fascination with stamp collecting, and a strong work ethic. Though he left school after completing grade six, Norman was proud of his skill in spelling, and he spoke both English and French. From a young age, he sought practical experience in various trades, working as a spring maker apprentice, a machinist’s helper alongside his father, a laborer at Montreal Laundry Co., and even as an Ordinary Seaman for Canada Steamship Lines.

Norman was not just industrious; he was also determined to serve his country, despite facing numerous health setbacks. His desire to join the military was clear—he attempted to enlist three times, each time under a slightly different name. On January 21, 1942, he first tried to enlist under the name “Eddy Rule” but was discharged due to “acute bronchitis” after only a few months. Not deterred, he tried again on April 19, 1943, this time as “William Percy Rule,” only to be discharged in September 1943 for “chronic bronchitis, asthmatic type.” Despite these medical setbacks, Norman’s commitment to the military did not waver. He continued to train with the hope of overcoming his physical limitations and even expressed a strong wish to join the Black Watch Regiment.

On January 5, 1944, he enlisted again—this time under his true name, Norman Sidney Rule. Although he had struggled with bronchitis and required educational support, his steadfast dedication was evident to his superiors, who described him as “tall and friendly” and “favourably inclined towards the army.” Standing at 5 feet 6.5 inches and weighing only 116 pounds, Norman was slender, but his resilience and ambition were unshakeable. Known to those around him as “Edward Percy,” he aspired to become a motor mechanic and hoped his military service would pave the way.

Finally, Norman was accepted and shipped overseas. After basic training in Canada from January to June 1944, he was sent to the United Kingdom and then deployed to the Italian front with the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, a reconnaissance unit of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. Despite the hardships and physical demands of military life, Norman served honorably in Italy, where he took part in intense combat operations.

Tragically, Private Norman Sidney Rule was killed in action on December 13, 1944, at the age of 21. His final resting place is in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he is buried in Plot V, Row C, Grave 10. His story is a testament to his unyielding determination to serve his country, even in the face of personal and health challenges. Norman’s courage, loyalty, and quiet tenacity remain part of his legacy, honored among the fallen who gave their lives in service during World War II
