Hugh Courtney Graham’s story is one of dedication, resilience, and sacrifice. 
Born on June 16, 1909, in St. Marys, Ontario, Hugh grew up in a large and close-knit family. He was the son of W. John and Bertha Graham and had four brothers—John Crawford, Francis Leon, Robert Alderson, and Joseph Evans—and three sisters, Dorothy, Ruth A., and Edith Faye. Two brothers and one sister predeceased him, leaving a legacy of a family deeply affected by loss and hardship.

Hugh’s early life reflected the challenges of the time. He left school after completing Grade 7 at the age of 14 to support his family. Over the years, he worked in a variety of roles, including as a farmhand, rubber worker, machine shop assistant, and laborer at a cement company. His work history highlighted his adaptability and willingness to take on physically demanding jobs to provide for his loved ones.

In November 1929, Hugh married Alice, and together they had three children: Alfred, Doris Bertha Virginia Alice, and Garry Morris William. Despite his responsibilities as a husband and father, Hugh felt compelled to serve his country during the Second World War. He enlisted on July 10, 1941, in London, Ontario, joining the Central Mechanization Depot of the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (R.C.O.C.). This was not Hugh’s first experience with the military; he had previously served with the Non-Permanent Active Militia (N.P.A.M.) in the Perth Regiment from 1938 to 1939.

Described as a rugged man of 5’10½” and 184 pounds, Hugh was well-built, direct, and friendly, though he displayed a touch of cynicism in his demeanor. He enjoyed sports such as hockey, baseball, fishing, and hunting, and was known for his cooperative nature and willingness to help others. While his aptitude for military training was considered limited, his personality was strong and stable, and he adapted well to army life. Although initially assigned as a stockroom storeman in the R.C.O.C., Hugh expressed a desire for more challenging and meaningful work, particularly in a machine shop.

In August 1943, Hugh noted that he preferred the camaraderie and action of a fighting unit over his logistical role, but his initial placement was influenced by his wife’s preferences. Despite this, his commitment to his duties never wavered. After 18 months in Canada, Hugh was deployed to the United Kingdom in October 1943, and in September 1944, he joined the Perth Regiment in Italy, taking part in the grueling Italian Campaign.

The Italian Campaign was marked by intense combat and harsh conditions as Allied forces fought to liberate Italy from German control. Hugh’s regiment faced immense challenges, including difficult terrain, enemy resistance, and the physical toll of sustained fighting.

Tragically, on December 20, 1944, Private Hugh Courtney Graham was killed in action at the age of 36. His sacrifice came during operations near Villanova, Italy.

Hugh was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot IV, Row B, Grave 8. His grave stands as a testament to his bravery and the ultimate sacrifice he made for his family and his country.

Hugh Graham’s story is one of a man who balanced his love for his family with his duty to his nation. From his humble beginnings in St. Marys to the battlefields of Italy, his journey reflects the courage and resilience of those who fought in the Second World War. 
Though his life was tragically cut short, his memory endures as a reminder of the sacrifices made for peace and freedom.





GRAHAM
“His Last Game”

How was the game, and what the score,
Dear pal of mine and brother in war?
Were innings timed as in day of peace,
Or did they linger when others ceased?
How was the "Ump”, harsh and crude,
Or gentle, old pal, in peace or feud?
And did he pat you on the back
As he guided you on to your homeward track?
How was the game, old pal of mine?
Too short I fear, your goal was timed,
And surely the “Ump” bowed head in shame
When he found that his time had
Finished your game.
How can I hope a different score,
Tho' I miss you, Hughie, 'tis the price of war
For war is a game, and a game
Played for keeps;
And God as the "Ump" just cannot be beat .
Now how can I question life's game done,
How can I wish you might have one?
For god knew best -but this I know-
That my heart went with you, when
The "Ump" called go !
