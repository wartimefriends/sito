+++

Born on February 13, 1922, in Fleming, Saskatchewan, William was 23 years old when he tragically lost his life in action on December 14, 1944. He is buried at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy.

William grew up in a large family, with his father Duncan Hector and mother Jean. He had six brothers—Hector, Vernon, Gerald (who was also serving overseas), Carl, Gordon, and Archie—as well as four sisters: Mrs. W. Jackson, Mae, Irene, and Winnifred.

Before enlisting, William worked as a farm laborer, having completed eight years of public schooling. His ambition was to pursue a career in engineering. He enlisted on September 18, 1941, in Regina, Saskatchewan, where he was initially assigned to the 12th District Depot, Canadian Active Service Force, and the Regina-based 101st Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Canadian Artillery.

His service took him through several theatres: he served in Canada from September 18, 1941, to August 8, 1942, then in the United Kingdom from August 9, 1942, to June 28, 1943. 
Finally, he was deployed to Italy, where he served from June 29, 1943, until his death on December 14, 1944. On November 27, 1943, his unit was re-designated as part of the Lanark and Renfrew Regiment.

Though his life was cut short, William’s dedication and ambition were evident. He is remembered by his family and honored in his resting place in Villanova War Cemetery, VI-B-4, a testament to his service and sacrifice. 

Letter written to Pte William Frances Moffat by Lane Erickson, a Canadian student visiting the Cemetery with his hockey team

Dear Sir
I would like to thank you for everything that you have done in protecting our country and
in fighting to save the Italians in VWVII. lt must have been extremely difficult when you
left home to go fight in the war at such a young age. Leaving your family knowing that
you might not come back alive must have been the hardest. I admire your courage,
bravery and heart to sacrifice yourself for others. I am deeply touched by this
extraordinary act of graciousness and kindness. I don't know if I would have had the
guts to leave my country and risk my neck in order to save others. But I might have
done it considering that you saved them from Hitler. Your defense must have been
impregnable and your attack so fierce to withstand the mighty force of the German
army. This to me and many folks like me is a huge accomplishment and milestone
which we will all remember.
Sincerely,

Lane Erickson
