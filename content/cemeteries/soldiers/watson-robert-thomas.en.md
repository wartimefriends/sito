<br>


Robert Thomas WATSON was born on September 7, 1924, in Rochester, New York, USA. As the eldest child of Robert and Ivy Watson, he grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia, where his family later settled. His only sibling was a half-brother, Gary C. Watson. Although Robert’s childhood was considered normal, he carried with him a reputation for being somewhat reckless, with a minor history of theft that reflected a carefree attitude toward life. Despite this, he was a pleasant and cooperative young man, known for his clean-cut appearance and affable nature.

Robert completed his formal education at the age of 17, finishing grade 9. Though his academic career was brief, he showed an interest in mechanics, with a desire to work as a driver-mechanic or dispatch rider. His hobbies included swimming, bowling, skating, and playing hockey as a goaltender. He also enjoyed baseball and softball, often playing in the field positions.

Seeking adventure, Robert enlisted in the Canadian Armed Forces on December 5, 1940, in Vancouver. He was just 16 at the time, but like many young men of his generation, he was drawn to the excitement and challenge of military service. Initially assigned to No. 11 District Sub/Depot in Vancouver, Robert trained in Canada until January 1942, when he was deployed to the UK. There, he would spend over a year, honing his skills and preparing for the grueling campaigns that awaited him.

On March 2, 1944, Robert was transferred to the Westminster Regiment (Motors) of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps. His regiment, known for its use of motorized vehicles, would later play a key role in the Italian Campaign, where mobility and mechanized warfare were critical.

Robert arrived in Italy on October 24, 1943, joining the Allied effort to push back German forces entrenched in the rugged and heavily fortified Italian terrain. The Italian Campaign was notorious for its harsh conditions, with intense battles fought over mountains, rivers, and fortified towns. Robert served bravely alongside his comrades, taking part in this difficult and bloody campaign.

Despite his youthful enthusiasm and skill as a driver and mechanic, Private Robert Watson’s journey came to a tragic end on November 30, 1944, when he was killed in action on the southern bank of the Montone River. He was just 20 years old. His final resting place is in Plot I, Row C, Grave 8 at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy.

Though his life was short, Robert’s service is remembered with honor. His adventurous spirit and willingness to embrace the challenges of war left a mark on those who served alongside him. From a carefree young man with a minor brush with trouble to a brave soldier who gave his life in the fight for freedom, Robert’s story is one of transformation and sacrifice.

The following is from The Westminster War Diary: 
"As if to see to it that the Force went out fighting (although such a thought must have been far from their minds) number 6 platoon of B Company became involved in a very stiff action during the last two days of Porter Force operations. The locale was the high dyked bank on the southern edge of the Montone river. The reason was that an attack across the river was imminent, and it was thought desirable to acquire as much real estate as possible on the near bank before the assault. It must be remembered that the enemy still made nightly forays back and forth across the stream. At 530 hours on 30th November, Lieut. Vic Wilson and his men attacked a group of three houses built right up against the bank (somewhat in what is now called the split level style) on "our" side of the river. After a brisk fight, the houses were taken and occupied, but the troubles of 6 platoon were only beginning. In front of them, at decidedly short range, a number of enemy positions dug into the dyke began making their fire felt. In addition to the usual small arms, they were well supplied with "bazookas" or faust patronen, likely intended for anti-tank work, but the firers apparently had no qualms about wasting them on houses or even men. Behind them, the besieged 6 platoon had a stretch of flat open ground, swept by enemy fire, which made it most difficult to effect reinforcement of the position. At 1400 hours a determined effort was made by enemy infantry to retake the houses, but it was beaten off by the equally determined B Company group. An hour later another attack was made, but again 6 platoon "saw them off" and finally at last light reinforcements were brought in under command of Lieut. Bruce  Eaton. 
This was the sort of action that does not make the front page of either the home papers or the "Maple Leaf". No one was awarded a "gong"; no one was mentioned in despatches, yet this small group did justice to their training and honour to their Regiment through their skill and perseverance under heavy fire, which unfortunately cost the life of Pte. R. T. Watson. A great debt was owed the "dyke-rats" of B Company's 6 platoon by those who took part later in the successful crossing of the Montone.
