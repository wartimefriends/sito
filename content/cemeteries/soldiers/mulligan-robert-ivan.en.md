Growing up in a small farming community, Robert left school after the eighth grade at age 14. His career began in mixed farming, primarily in Peace River, Alberta, where he worked from 1921 to 1939. His long-term goal was to own a farm himself, though he held various other jobs over the years. He enjoyed the outdoors and was passionate about sports, particularly hunting, fishing, and softball, where he often played third base.

Robert was married to Mildred Regina from Regina, Saskatchewan, with whom he shared a life before he enlisted. At the time of his enlistment, he was living in Scotland, Ontario, and he supported both his wife and his mother. Though his reason for enlisting isn’t documented, his commitment led him to enlist in Brantford, Ontario, on September 7, 1939, joining the C/54th Field Battery, Royal Canadian Artillery (R.C.A.), part of the Canadian Active Service Force (C.A.S.F.).

His service took him across multiple theaters of war. He trained in Canada from his enlistment until December 1939, after which he was stationed in the United Kingdom from December 11, 1939, to June 15, 1943. 
On June 16, 1943, Robert was deployed to Italy, where he remained for the remainder of his service. During this time, his regiment was redesignated as part of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish on October 26, 1944.

Described in his service notes as 5’7” tall with blue eyes, Robert was deemed suitable for roles such as Gunner in Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) or Field Artillery. On December 13, 1944, at the age of 38, Robert made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, giving his life in Italy. 
He is now laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, his grave marked in Section VI, Row C, Plot 8.

Robert’s life, from a farmer with dreams of owning his land to a soldier who served across continents, reflects the resilience and commitment of those who gave everything during the Second World War. 
His legacy endures in the memory of his family and those who honor him for his service and sacrifice.
