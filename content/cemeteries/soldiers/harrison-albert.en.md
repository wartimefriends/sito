Lance Corporal Albert Harrison’s story is one of youthful determination, service, and sacrifice, reflecting the aspirations and dedication of a young man who gave everything for his country. 
Born on July 27, 1924, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Albert was the sixth of nine children in a hardworking family. His parents, Charles and Lena, raised Albert alongside his brothers Donald, Robert, Douglas, Gordon, Harold, and Charles (half-brother) and his sisters Edith and Marion. With an Irish father and a French-Canadian mother, Albert grew up in a culturally diverse and supportive home environment.

Albert’s early years were shaped by modest opportunities and hard work. He completed grade nine at age 16 in a city school before leaving to support his family. His work experience included various labor-intensive jobs, from delivering goods for Eastman Photographic Co. to crafting blankets at Fairfield and Sons Woolen Mills. These roles showcased his dedication to earning a living and helping his family. Despite his humble beginnings, Albert was an active young man with a love for sports like rugby, hockey (defense), boxing, and skiing. His hobbies included roller-skating, stamp collecting, and tinkering with radios, demonstrating a curious and mechanical mind.

Standing at 5’4½” and weighing 126 pounds, Albert was described as a pleasant, determined, and intelligent young man with good average learning ability and mechanical aptitude. He was a member of the Winnipeg Roller Rink, preferred outdoor activities, and abstained from drinking or dancing, reflecting his serious and focused personality. His desire to excel was evident in his dream of becoming a paratrooper or commando, fueled by his confidence in his physical capabilities and boxing and wrestling experience.

Albert’s military journey began on January 18, 1943, when he enlisted in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Previously, he had been a member of the Winnipeg Grenadiers Reserves, training in wireless communication two nights a week from October 1942 until his enlistment. While his heart was set on joining the paratroopers, concerns about his steadiness during training led to his assignment in other roles. After completing basic training, Albert was transferred to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (PLDG) in September 1944, joining the Canadian Armoured Corps.

Deployed overseas in August 1943, Albert served in the United Kingdom before being sent to Italy in November 1943 to join the grueling Italian Campaign. 
As part of the 4th PLDG, a reconnaissance regiment, Albert took part in dangerous missions requiring bravery, resilience, and adaptability. These operations played a crucial role in the Allied effort to push German forces out of Italy.

Tragically, on December 13, 1944, Lance Corporal Albert Harrison was killed in action during a reconnaissance operation in Italy. At just 20 years old, his life was cut short, leaving behind a family proud of his service and sacrifice. 
He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he lies in plot II. C .4. His grave stands as a solemn reminder of the price of freedom and the courage of those who gave their lives in its pursuit.

Albert’s story is one of aspiration, resilience, and devotion. From his dreams of being a paratrooper to his dedication to his regiment, he embodied the spirit of service and sacrifice. Though his life ended too soon, Lance Corporal Albert Harrison’s memory lives on, a testament to the courage and determination of his generation.
