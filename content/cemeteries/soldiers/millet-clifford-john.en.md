Private Clifford John MILLET, a devoted soldier with the Westminster Regiment (Motors) of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, lived a life filled with both incredible talent and a deep commitment to service. 
Born on July 29, 1922, in Calgary, Alberta, Clifford grew up with varied interests and skills, excelling in academics, sports, and the arts. Although he lost both his parents early on, he persevered, channeling his energies into a wealth of pursuits that showcased his resilience and adaptability.

Raised primarily in Montreal, Clifford attended Jesuit College and then Loyola College, where he completed three years of study. A well-rounded student, he excelled in English, mathematics, and history. He enjoyed team sports, including hockey, softball, and Canadian football, and was an active member of the Boy Scouts. Clifford was not only academically inclined but also artistically talented; he participated in school plays and even ventured into professional entertainment. For a year, he performed as a radio singer with a rich baritone voice on CHYC in Montreal and WBZ in Springfield, Massachusetts. His stage experience included six months as an actor, a skill that showcased his charisma and presence.

After leaving school at 17 to support himself, Clifford’s occupational background became as diverse as his talents. Over the years, he held roles as a steelworker, bookkeeper, retail clerk, camera repairman, and copper inspector. He even worked briefly as a men’s furnishings clerk at Eaton’s department store. Despite these varied roles, his love for the arts remained, and his hobbies included singing, reading biographies, and following current events.

In 1942, at 20 years old, Clifford was encouraged by a friend to enlist in the army, a decision he embraced with enthusiasm. Initially interested in joining the Royal Canadian Artillery, he joined the ranks of the Westminster Regiment, where he was seen as “N.C.O. material” for his positive attitude, good appearance, and keen intellect. Known for his fresh complexion, blue eyes, and attractive personality, Clifford stood out among his peers. Although he had no family to support financially, his commitment to duty was unwavering. His wife, Eveline, served in the Canadian Women’s Army Corps, making their union one bound by shared dedication to their country.

After training in Canada, Clifford deployed to the United Kingdom in August 1943, eventually reaching Italy in February 1944, where he would spend the remainder of his service. Italy’s front lines proved challenging, and on September 2, 1944, he was wounded in action. He spent three weeks recovering in the hospital but returned to his unit with unbroken resolve.

On December 29, 1944, Clifford was killed in action along the Naviglio Canal, less than two miles East of Villa Prati, Bagnacavallo. At just 33 years old, he had lived a life marked by both triumph and sacrifice, leaving behind a legacy of courage, dedication, and extraordinary skill. 
He is buried in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot II, Row A, Grave 10. His memory lives on through the lives he touched with his vibrant personality, his talents, and his unwavering service. 
Clifford John Millet’s life story stands as a testament to the diverse and remarkable individuals who sacrificed everything for a cause greater than themselves.

Article from a local newspaper
Pte. Clifford John Millet, whose wife resides at 773 Seymour.
Pte. Millet, 33, was a native of Montreal, where he was a chartered accountant when he enlisted in 1942. A graduate in Arts from McGill University, and only son of the late Dr. and Mrs. John Millet of Montreal, he served at Whitehorse and was married here before going overseas in August, 1943.
He was killed in action with the Westminster Regiment (M) on December 29, after having been wounded twice, at the Melfa River crossing on May 24, and again at the approaches to the Rimini airfield on September 2.
A week before his death he wrote to his wife, who served with the C.W.A.C. for two years, describing how he and a few friends had paid a visit to a nearby Italian hospital on Christmas morning, and given the children there all the candy the men had been sent in their Christmas parcels.
