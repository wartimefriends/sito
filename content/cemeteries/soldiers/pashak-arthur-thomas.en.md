Arthur attended school up to the high school entrance level but left because he didn’t enjoy it. Despite his early departure from formal education, he was known to have average intelligence and kept himself informed by reading newspapers and magazines. A Roman Catholic, he attended church fairly regularly, reflecting his family’s strong faith.

Before enlisting, Arthur worked as a railroad brakeman for the Canadian National Railway (CNR) for nine months. This job highlighted his willingness to take on responsibility and engage in physically demanding work. Standing at 5 feet 5½ inches tall and weighing 146 pounds, he had a medium complexion, blue eyes, and dark brown hair. Described as a very pleasant chap, he enjoyed playing hockey and had aspirations of returning to the railroad after his military service.

Motivated by a sense of duty and a desire to be active, Arthur enlisted in the Canadian Army on May 8, 1942, in Edmonton, Alberta. Although he had fervently applied to join the Navy, he was called up for Army service and embraced his role. Initially assigned to the Midland Regiment, he served in Canada until March 22, 1943. On that date, he was deployed to the United Kingdom, where he continued his training and service.

While in the UK, Arthur was taken on strength by the Irish Regiment of Canada on June 18, 1943. This transfer marked a significant step in his military career, aligning him with a unit known for its distinguished service. 
On October 24, 1943, he arrived in Italy to participate in the Italian Campaign—a series of critical operations aimed at liberating the country from Axis forces.

During his time in Italy, Arthur served as a rifleman in the Support Company (SP Company) of his regiment. He seemed well-suited to military life, expressing satisfaction with his role. On September 13, 1944, he was slightly wounded near Coriano when a high-explosive shell struck the house he was in. Fragments of bricks and debris caused abrasions and lacerations to both his legs. Despite these injuries, he demonstrated resilience and a commitment to return to his duties.

Tragically, Private Arthur Thomas Pashak was killed in action on January 2, 1945, at the age of 23. At the time of his death, his regiment was involved in operations near the river crossing of the Lamone between Conventello and Sant Alberto, in Italy. His loss was deeply felt by his family and comrades, who remembered him for his pleasant nature and dedication. He was laid to rest at the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot II, Row C, Grave 8.

Remembered for his commitment and courage, Private Pashak exemplified the spirit of countless Canadians who served during World War II. His aspirations to serve his country, whether in the Navy or Army, and his hope to return to civilian life afterward, reflect the experiences of many young men of his generation. 
His service and ultimate sacrifice remain a proud part of his family’s legacy and Canada’s military history.
