#### Perth Regiment, R.C.I.C.
<br>


Private Roy Otto LOSCH of the Perth Regiment, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, was a young man from Kitchener, Ontario, whose journey from a small-town rubber worker to a frontline soldier reflects the quiet resilience of many who served in World War II. 

Born on June 19, 1923, Roy grew up in a Lutheran family with his father, Robert, who worked on a fox farm, and his mother, Ida. He had two sisters, Mrs. Bignell, who resided in Kitchener, and Dorothy.

Roy’s early years were spent working various jobs to support himself and his family. He attended school for eleven years in Ontario, achieving Grade 9 and beginning a technical Grade 10 program in motor mechanics, machine shop, and woodworking. However, financial need led him to leave school at seventeen to work, taking up a series of jobs including labor in a button factory and, eventually, operating latex machines and splicing inner tubes in a rubber factory. He continued this work for two and a half years, though the dust and conditions began to affect his lungs, prompting him to consider other options.

On November 20, 1942, Roy was called up under the National Resources Mobilization Act (NRMA), which required men to serve domestically during the war. Initially hesitant, he enlisted on January 18, 1943, in Chatham, Ontario, and began training with the No. 1 District Depot. 
Though not initially committed to overseas service, he expressed an interest in driving and hoped for a role as a truck driver in the army. However, with little experience, he was recommended for service as an infantry rifleman. Roy’s training first took him across Canada, where he served until May 1943, before embarking for the United Kingdom in mid-May.

In April 1944, Roy joined the Perth Regiment and was eventually deployed to Italy on March 28, 1944, as part of the Allied advance. 
Known for his easygoing nature and slight frame, standing 5 feet 7 inches and weighing 142 pounds, Roy was a dependable and steady soldier. He had a medium-dark complexion, brown eyes, and dark brown hair, traits that, combined with his quiet demeanor, earned him respect among his peers. 
Described as having “slightly above average intelligence” and good health, he was eager to contribute but uncertain about his post-war aspirations, though he hoped to find a sense of purpose in his military service.

Roy’s interests reflected the life of a young man with wide-ranging curiosities and passions. He loved dancing, frequent trips to the theater, and reading light fiction and current events. He had a passion for sports, particularly baseball, where he played as both pitcher and catcher, as well as tennis. Additionally, he enjoyed collecting stamps, a hobby that provided him a quiet respite from the demands of his everyday work.

As a soldier, Roy was adaptable, facing new challenges with determination. 
In Italy, he encountered difficult conditions and fierce combat that demanded every ounce of his strength and resolve. 
Sadly, Roy’s journey came to a sudden end on December 20, 1944, during one of the conflict’s intense and tragic battles.
At just 21 years of age, Private Roy Otto Losch was killed in action on the Fosso Munio banks , a profound loss for his family and community.

Roy now rests in Villanova War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot IV, Row C, Grave 8, alongside many of his comrades who also gave their lives for their country. His legacy lives on, remembered as a young man with dreams and ambitions who sacrificed everything in the pursuit of peace. 
Roy’s story stands as a testament to the quiet bravery of those who, with courage and resolve, stepped forward to serve their country in its time of need.


-How Elio Minguzzi’s family and Roy Otto Losch’s family are connected -
Elio Minguzzi was a two-year old child when the Canadians were in Villanova. He was living with his mother and father at the beginning of Via Cocchi.
He has no memories of his own of the Canadians, but his father has often told him about the Canadian soldiers, who were billeted at the family house and who provided food for the whole family. Food was in short in those days and many people risked starvation!
For many reasons, Canadians have always had a special place in his heart.

When Elio married, he moved along with his wife into a new house just opposite the Canadian War Cemetery, and a few years later, in 1971, their first son was born. Elio and his wife needed to choose a name for the boy, so Elio decided to go to the cemetery and have a look through the register of the dead
He chose the name Roy, in memory of Pte Roy Otto LOSCH, and recalls that his son was always very happy with the name that had been chosen for him.

Unfortunately Roy Minguzzi tragically died at the age of just 36. His father wrote the following words, and placed them by Roy’s grave:

“I gave you the name of one of the heroes who rest in peace behind our house. 
Like him, you lost your battle for life. You had the same destiny as him. 
The great love which you had for your family will give your son strength to face this world where joys are like feathers and griefs are like rocks”.

Your father
