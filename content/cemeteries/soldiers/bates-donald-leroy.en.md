Lance Corporal Donald Leroy Bates was born on April 8, 1921, in Glanford Station, Ontario, to John Stanley and Hilda Valeria Bates. Raised on a family farm, Donald grew up alongside his brother, Ralph Warren, and sisters, Hana Florence and Joyce Mildred. 
His childhood was shaped by the rhythms of rural life, instilling in him a strong work ethic and a sense of responsibility that would later define his military career.

At 5’7”, with a dark complexion, brown eyes, and dark brown hair, Donald was described as a “tall, husky young chap” with an average intelligence and a knack for mechanical work. 
After attending Caledonia High School for a year, he left at 17, seeking hands-on opportunities over academic pursuits. He completed a six-week War Emergency Course in machine shop skills, further honing his practical abilities.

Donald worked a variety of jobs before enlisting, gaining experience in construction, farming, and manufacturing. Notably, he spent 19 months in the stockroom at the Otis-Fenson Elevator Company in Hamilton, Ontario, where he supported munitions production during the early war years. His familiarity with machinery and tools, combined with his ability to drive motorcycles, cars, and trucks, reflected his versatility and technical aptitude.

On September 17, 1942, at the age of 21, Donald enlisted in Hamilton, Ontario, joining the Royal Canadian Artillery (RCA). Initially assigned to the #2 District Depot (AF) R.C.A. Heavy Anti-Aircraft Wing, he expressed a desire to serve as a storeman, leveraging his prior experience with munitions and mechanical equipment. While his initial evaluations noted that he should “become an average soldier,” Donald proved to be much more, excelling in his training and earning a reputation as a reliable gunner.

After completing basic training in Canada, Donald was posted to the United Kingdom on March 30, 1943, and later to Italy on June 12, 1943. His assignments saw him moving between artillery units before being redesignated to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment on October 26, 1944. This transition marked his shift to the infantry during one of the most challenging phases of the Italian Campaign.

Donald served in Italy during a period of intense combat as Allied forces pushed northward against German defenses. 
On December 15, 1944, at the age of 23, he was killed in action during operations near the Senio River, a critical battleground in northern Italy. 
His death came just one day after his regiment endured heavy losses in the same area, underscoring the relentless nature of the fighting.

Donald was laid to rest in the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, in Plot VII, Row C, Grave 1. His burial site stands as a lasting tribute to his courage and sacrifice.

Lance Corporal Donald Leroy Bates exemplified the determination and selflessness of his generation. From his early days working on the family farm to his contributions on the battlefield, he displayed a steadfast commitment to duty and a willingness to serve in whatever capacity was needed. 
Though his life was tragically cut short, his legacy endures in the memories of his family and in the history of Canada’s contributions to World War II.
