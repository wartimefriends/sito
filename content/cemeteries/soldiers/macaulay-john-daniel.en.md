Leaving school at the age of 12 after completing Grade 7, John embarked on a life of hard work. His early years were spent helping on his uncle’s mixed farm in Prince Edward Island, where he gained valuable skills and an enduring work ethic. In 1925, he moved on to work as a melter’s helper for Dominion Iron and Steel Corporation, a demanding role that honed his physical resilience. By 1931, John had found his true calling as a barber. He established his own business in Sydney, Nova Scotia, working as a self-employed barber for nearly a decade. Known for his pleasant personality and quiet manner, he developed a loyal clientele and looked forward to the idea of expanding his business after the war.

John had a rich personal life as well, with hobbies that reflected his warm and creative spirit. He enjoyed music and was talented on both the guitar and piano, frequently entertaining those around him. He was active in sports, especially swimming, skating, and softball, where he played shortstop on his local team. 
Although married to his wife Helen, they had been living apart for about a year, yet she remained his next of kin and was supportive of his decision to serve.

On July 7, 1941, at the age of 34, John enlisted in the Canadian Army in Sydney, driven by a sense of duty to his country. Assigned initially to the No. 6 District Depot, he served as a barber for his regiment, bringing his trade skills to support his fellow soldiers. His military record notes his quiet ambition and suitability for steady work. At 5’6½” and 140 pounds, with hazel eyes and good health, John was a reliable and disciplined presence within his regiment. His service began in Canada, and he was later deployed to the United Kingdom in March 1942, where he continued his training and service.

In May 1944, John was transferred to the Westminster Regiment (Motor) of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, a unit that would see intense action in Italy. 
By that time, he was both a barber and a rifleman, roles he took on with equal dedication. The Italian Campaign was arduous, filled with harsh conditions and fierce combat as Allied forces pushed to liberate the country from Axis control. John adapted to the demands of his dual roles, providing comfort to his comrades through his barbering skills while also standing alongside them on the front lines.

Tragically, on December 16, 1944, John Daniel MacAulay was killed in action at the age of 37. His life was cut short as he bravely served his regiment, and he was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy. 
His passing left a profound void for his family, friends, and the community he had served both as a barber and a soldier.

John’s story is one of dedication and service. From his humble beginnings on a farm to his final days on the battlefield, he exemplified the spirit of resilience and duty. His legacy lives on in the memories of those who knew him and in the history of those who served for the freedoms we cherish today. 
Private John Daniel MacAulay’s life reminds us of the many contributions made by ordinary men who became extraordinary through their courage and sacrifice.
