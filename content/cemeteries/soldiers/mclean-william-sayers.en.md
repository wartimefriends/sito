Trooper William Sayers McLEAN, a dedicated soldier in the 3rd Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, Governor General’s Horse Guards, Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, demonstrated a strong commitment to service throughout his life. Born on December 2, 1913, in Vancouver, British Columbia, William was raised in a family that valued hard work and resilience. His parents, William and Florence, supported his ambitions, and his only sibling, Douglas Robert, served in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), reflecting the family’s shared sense of duty.

William had a solid educational background, completing his Grade XII Technical Matriculation with a focus on automotive mechanics. He pursued this interest further by attending Vancouver Technical School and night courses, eventually mastering automotive mechanics. Known for his intelligence and diligence, he excelled in technical subjects and was highly regarded for his ability to work well with others. Outside of academics, William enjoyed tennis, skiing, and reading.

Before joining the army, William worked seven years as an office clerk and spent two years mining hard rock. In early 1941, he enlisted in the RCAF as a student pilot, where he completed ground school and excelled in technical courses on aero engines and signals. Despite his promise, he was unable to complete the flight training, washing out a week before graduation. Nevertheless, his potential was recognized, and he was seen as having officer material qualities due to his intelligence, alertness, and dedication.

On January 7, 1942, William enlisted in the Canadian Army in Calgary, Alberta, seeking more active involvement and preferring the dynamic environment of the armoured corps. His aptitude for technical work was soon recognized, and he was recommended for advanced training. He completed his basic training in Camrose, Alberta, where he was held as an instructor for 12 months, demonstrating his skills and leadership potential.

In April 1943, he was sent to No. 1 Canadian Armoured Corps Training Regiment at Camp Borden, Ontario. There, he completed training as a qualified Gunner Operator, specializing in General Military Training (GMT), wireless operations, and driver mechanics. His instructors noted his intelligence, sincerity, and resilience, although he was briefly referred to psychiatry due to undiagnosed stomach pains, potentially linked to anxiety. Despite these challenges, he remained steadfast and was considered suitable for promotion.

After rigorous training in Canada, William was deployed to the United Kingdom on April 30, 1944. Following a six-month stint in the UK, he was sent to Italy on November 3, 1944, where he joined the Allied forces during the intense Italian campaign. His role as a Gunner Operator in the Governor General’s Horse Guards allowed him to bring his technical expertise to the battlefield.

On December 24, 1944, at the age of 31, Trooper William Sayers McLean was killed in action. 
His sacrifice is commemorated at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot V, Row C, Grave 1. William’s life, from a skilled mechanic and student pilot to a soldier dedicated to his country, embodies resilience, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to duty. His legacy endures in the memories of those who knew him as a quiet, sincere man who always strived to do his best.
