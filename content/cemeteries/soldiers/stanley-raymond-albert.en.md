<br>


Raymond Albert STANLEY was born on July 9, 1922, in Almonte, Ontario, to Alfred and Minnie Stanley. He grew up in a large, working-class family with two brothers, Cecil and Allen Ross, and five sisters: Lottie, Doris, Retta, Betty, and Mrs. W. Steele. Raymond’s childhood was typical of a small-town boy in Ontario during the Great Depression. 
He attended school for six years, leaving at the age of 13 to support his family by working as a baker’s helper. He had aspirations to become a shoemaker but was caught up, like many young men of his time, in the sweeping tides of global conflict.

On July 17, 1941, at the age of 19, Raymond enlisted in the Canadian Army in Ottawa, Ontario. His enlistment was likely driven by a sense of duty and adventure, though specific reasons for his enlistment were not documented. He had already served for a year in the reserves with the Lanark & Renfrew Scottish Regiment, indicating his early interest in military service. After enlisting, Raymond was initially assigned to the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (RCOC), where he trained until March 12, 1942, before being transferred to the UK on March 13, 1942, as part of the war effort.

His time in the UK was spent preparing for the rigors of battle. The next two years were marked by intense training as he, along with thousands of Canadian soldiers, awaited deployment to the front lines. His transfer to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards in July 1944 marked a turning point in his military career, sending him into one of the most grueling theaters of war—Italy.

By July 17, 1944, Raymond had disembarked in Italy, joining the fight against Axis forces. The Italian Campaign, known for its brutal conditions and the tenacious German defensive positions, became the proving ground for Canadian soldiers. The 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards were deeply involved in this effort, taking part in key operations to breach the formidable Gothic Line, which the Germans had fortified to slow the Allied advance.

For Raymond, the realities of war in Italy were far from the adventure many had initially imagined. The mud, cold, and constant threat of artillery fire, coupled with the dense terrain, made each day a struggle for survival. It was during one such battle, on December 13, 1944, at the Naviglio Canal at Villa Prati that Private Stanley was killed in action. The circumstances of his death are not explicitly detailed in official records, but like so many others, he likely fell while his regiment pushed forward in a final effort to break the enemy lines.

Raymond’s body was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he lies alongside many of his comrades who fought and died in the same campaign. His grave, located in plot V B 9, serves as a lasting tribute to his sacrifice. Although Raymond’s military career was tragically short, his contribution to the Allied war effort was profound. He, like many of his generation, left behind family and future ambitions, stepping forward to serve his country during its time of greatest need.

His family, living far from the battlefields in Almonte, Ontario, was left to mourn the loss of their son and brother. The grief of losing Raymond, one of many in a long list of Canadian casualties, was felt deeply across the country. His story is one of courage, sacrifice, and a life cut short by the horrors of war, but it is also a reminder of the price of freedom.
