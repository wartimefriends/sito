Born on April 29, 1909, in Kenmore, Ontario, near Ottawa, Alexander grew up in a rural, hardworking family. His parents, Alexander and May McLean, had married in Chesterville, Ontario, and raised a large family in Tomstown, Ontario. Alexander was one of several siblings, including brothers Gordon, Norman, Alan, Wallace, and Keith, as well as a sister, Katherine, who served as a lieutenant in the Nursing Service with the 7th Canadian Hospital.

Alexander initially enlisted with the Canadian Forestry Corps (CFC) on August 13, 1940. After advanced training overseas with the CFC in April 1941, he was employed as an Edgerman and Log Canter, working until October 12, 1943, when he returned to Canada. Despite being granted a six-month forestry leave, Alexander stayed only a week before returning, due to a dispute with Selective Service. 
His Personnel Selection Record from April 18, 1944, reflects his willingness to return to active duty, and he expressed a preference for joining the Royal Canadian Engineers (R.C.E.) to serve alongside his younger brother, Norman, who was stationed overseas with the 14th Field Company, R.C.E. Although he was ultimately unable to join the Engineers due to specific qualification requirements, Alexander remained committed and cooperative, expressing his readiness to serve in the Infantry if necessary.

Alexander’s life was deeply rooted in family values and a strong work ethic. For ten years before his military service, he had lived on his family’s farm, working tirelessly to build a house and stable, paying taxes, and supporting his parents. His mother, May, in a Department of National Defence form dated January 15, 1945, expressed her pride in his hard work on the farm, noting that she and her husband were left without help and not young, with four of their children serving overseas.

Tragically, Alexander’s service overseas was cut short. 
In the same year, his brother, Keith McLean, a Sapper with the 10th Field Squadron, was killed in action in Italy on January 12, 1945. Alexander himself was later killed, and Colonel C.L. Laurin, Director of Records, informed their mother, Louisa, on January 3, 1946, that both Alexander and Keith had been carefully reburied together in the same grave in Italy. Due to the limited space, it was not possible to bury them side by side, but they were honored with a shared resting place, symbolizing their close bond.

In 1947, a photograph of the brothers’ grave and marker was sent to their mother, a testament to their sacrifice and the profound impact they left on their family. The McLean family’s grief deepened when Louisa May McLean passed away on July 29, 1951, leaving her surviving sons, who had returned to Englehart, Ontario, to continue their legacy.

Alexander and Keith McLean’s shared grave in Italy stands as a poignant reminder of their devotion to duty and the lasting bonds of family. Their story reflects the resilience, sacrifice, and love that characterized the McLean family’s contributions during one of history’s most challenging times.
