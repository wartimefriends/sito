#### 1 Field Sqn., Royal Canadian Engineers
<br>


Sapper William James Kennedy, Service Number 015288, served with the 1st Field Squadron of the Royal Canadian Engineers. 
Born on June 26, 1906, in Gaspé, Quebec, William grew up in a large family as the sixth of seven children. His parents, Joseph and Genevieve Kennedy, raised him alongside his brothers Albert and Joseph (who served with the Royal Canadian Artillery in England) and sisters Sylvia, Janet, Hilda, and Helen. A Roman Catholic of British descent, William embodied the rugged determination of his rural upbringing.

William completed three years of public school before leaving formal education at 16 to work and support his family. His employment history reflected a man accustomed to hard labor. From 1919 to 1936, he worked various jobs in construction and bush work, earning $18.00 a week. He later spent three years gold mining at the East Malartic Gold Mine in North Quebec, where he earned $28.00 weekly. His experience also included a year working on furnaces for Robert Michell in Montreal and some time farming in southern Quebec. 
Despite his hard-working nature, William was described as indifferent and lacking ambition in his career goals, though he expressed an interest in mechanic work after the war.

Standing 5’6” and weighing 138 pounds, with brown eyes, dark brown hair, and a medium complexion, William was physically robust and capable. His military file noted that he wore glasses and passed a color vision test. His weight gain during his first year in the military—from 125 pounds in May 1941 to 138 pounds in January 1942—was a testament to the physical conditioning of army life.

William enlisted in the Canadian Army on May 8, 1941, joining No. 4 District Depot in Montreal. By September 27, 1941, he was transferred to the 1st Field Squadron, Royal Canadian Engineers, where he quickly proved his worth. His superiors recognized him as a skilled sapper and a qualified Pioneer “C,” stating that his transfer from the unit would be a significant loss.

William’s military journey took him from Canada to the United Kingdom in October 1941, where he served for two years before being deployed to Italy in October 1943. As part of the Italian Campaign, William’s unit was responsible for constructing bridges, clearing obstacles, and ensuring the mobility of Allied forces in challenging and dangerous conditions.

Tragically, William’s service came to an end on December 29, 1944, when he was killed in action at the age of 38. 
He was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot III, Row C, Grave 4.

Sapper William James Kennedy’s life was one of hard work, resilience, and quiet dedication. His contributions as a member of the Royal Canadian Engineers exemplify the essential but often unheralded work of combat engineers, whose efforts ensured the success of Allied operations. 
His sacrifice is a solemn reminder of the cost of war and the courage of those who answered the call to serve.
