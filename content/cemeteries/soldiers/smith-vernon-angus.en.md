+++


Vernon Angus Smith was born on February 9, 1921, in Brantford, Ontario, into a large and hardworking family. As the eldest child of Edwin and Ada L. Smith, he grew up with the responsibilities of looking out for his five brothers—John E., James M., Donald C., and William E.—and three sisters—Mildred A., Jeanette S., and Myrtle A. Raised in a devout Salvation Army household, Vernon’s upbringing was steeped in values of dedication, faith, and perseverance.

Vernon left school at the young age of 13, compelled to join the workforce to help support his family. Despite his limited education, he worked a series of physically demanding jobs, including a stint at a meat-packing plant, five years on a tobacco farm, and some experience in dairy farming. His goal was to secure a more stable future as a machinist, a path he hoped to pursue after his time working at Proctors Packers in Brantford. Vernon was an outdoorsman at heart, enjoying hunting, fishing, and swimming, as well as team sports like hockey and volleyball. He also had a talent for playing the harmonica, learning to play by ear.

Driven by a strong sense of patriotism, Vernon enlisted in the Canadian Army on July 4, 1940, in his hometown of Brantford, Ontario. He joined the Dufferin & Haldimand Rifles of Canada, where he began his journey as a soldier. Despite facing challenges in adapting to military life, largely due to his lack of formal education and some disciplinary issues, Vernon’s dedication to service never wavered. His instructors noted his cooperative nature and a willingness to do his best when given the opportunity, believing that with the right guidance, he could develop into a disciplined soldier.

Vernon’s service record reflects his commitment to the cause. He served in Canada from the day he enlisted until May 12, 1943, when he was deployed to the United Kingdom. After almost a year in the UK, he was sent to the Italian front on May 4, 1944, where the brutal realities of World War II awaited him. He joined the Westminster Regiment (Motor), R.C.I.C., on September 9, 1944, as the Allied forces pushed forward against German defenses in Italy.

Tragically, Vernon’s life was cut short on December 16, 1944, when he was killed in action during intense fighting in Italy. He was only 23 years old. Private Vernon Angus Smith was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in plot VII C 10, with a service conducted by Honorary Captain D.R.G. Owen, the padre of the Westminster Regiment, on December 18, 1944. His final resting place serves as a somber reminder of his ultimate sacrifice.

Vernon Angus Smith’s story is one of perseverance, duty, and sacrifice. Despite the challenges he faced in life, from leaving school at a young age to the rigors of war, he remained steadfast in his commitment to his country and his comrades. His journey from a young laborer in Brantford to a soldier on the front lines of Italy is a testament to his courage and resilience. Vernon’s legacy lives on in the hearts of his family, the community he left behind, and the military brothers and sisters who continue to honor his memory.
