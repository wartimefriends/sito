Perth Regiment R.C.I.C.

A Life of Leadership and Sacrifice:

Sergeant Robert James Dickson was born on April 7, 1919, in Galt, Ontario, the fourth of six children in a hardworking family. Raised by his mother, Bessie, after the passing of his father, David—a veteran of the First World War—Robert grew up with two brothers, Edward and Joseph, and three sisters, Jean, Helen, and Janet. The values of service and responsibility were instilled in him from a young age, shaping the man he would become.

Robert’s education began at Galt Collegiate, where he pursued a technical course and developed an interest in electricity. He completed Grade 11 before leaving school at age 18 to enter the workforce. 
His early employment included three years as a saw and tool fitter at Canadian Office and School Furniture Co. in Preston, Ontario, as well as work as a farm laborer. Robert also managed a small mink farm at home and aspired to expand it after the war.

Standing 5’9” tall and weighing 168 pounds, Robert was a strong and capable young man with brown eyes, brown hair, and a medium complexion. He was active and athletic, enjoying softball, volleyball, basketball, tennis, fishing, hunting, and swimming. 
A member of the Young People’s Union at his Presbyterian Church, Robert balanced his industrious nature with a love for leisure, attending movies and listening to the radio in his free time.

Robert’s desire to “see action and do something” led him to enlist in the Canadian Army on August 9, 1940, in Brantford, Ontario. Joining the Dufferin and Haldimand Rifles of Canada, he completed basic and advanced training, excelling in leadership courses. 
His determination and aptitude earned him recognition, and he rose through the ranks, completing a Junior Leaders Course in April 1942, a Regimental N.C.O. Course, and a Battle Drill Course in 1943. By July 1943, he was deemed “well above average” in learning ability and capable of leading a platoon.

Robert served in Canada until June 1943, when he was deployed to the United Kingdom for further training. 
On July 17, 1944, he joined the Perth Regiment in Italy, stepping into one of the most grueling theaters of the Second World War. His leadership and skill as a platoon sergeant were invaluable during the Allied push through Italy.

On September 13, 1944, Robert was wounded in action and treated at the 5th Canadian Casualty Clearing Station before being discharged from the 14th Canadian General Hospital on September 25. Undeterred, he returned to his unit, continuing to lead his men with resilience and determination.

Tragically, Robert’s service came to an end on December 20, 1944, when he was killed in action near the Fosso Munio during intense combat operations. 
He was 25 years old.

Sergeant Robert James Dickson was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Italy, Plot IV, Row A, Grave 2. His grave is a solemn tribute to a young man whose leadership, bravery, and sacrifice epitomize the spirit of his generation.

From a small-town boy with big aspirations to a platoon sergeant leading his men through the crucible of war, Robert’s story is one of courage, determination, and service. 
His legacy endures in the hearts of his family, his comrades, and the history of the Perth Regiment, reminding us of the immense cost of freedom and the enduring impact of those who gave everything for it.
