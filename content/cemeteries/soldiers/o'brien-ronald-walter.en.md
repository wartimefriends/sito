Ronald Walter O’Brien was born on September 30, 1920, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He was the eldest child of Peter and Elsie O’Brien. His father, Peter, served with the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps (RCASC) at the Canadian Military Headquarters (CMHQ) in London, England. Ronald had one brother, Earl, who resided in Newmarket, Ontario, and three sisters: Melba, Darleen, and Joyce. Raised in a family with a strong military connection, Ronald was inspired by his father’s service and developed a desire to follow in his footsteps.

Growing up in Ottawa, Ronald attended local schools and completed his education before entering the workforce. He worked as a plumber’s helper for W. Edge in Ottawa, earning $20 per week. His hands-on experience in plumbing reflected his practical skills and work ethic. Standing at 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing 148 pounds, he had brown eyes, brown hair, and a fair complexion. Known for his fair appearance and cheerful disposition, Ronald was an active young man who enjoyed building model aircraft—a hobby that showcased his attention to detail and interest in mechanics.

An avid sports enthusiast, Ronald played hockey as a right wing and baseball as a shortstop. His involvement in team sports demonstrated his teamwork skills and competitive spirit. These interests, along with his fascination for signaling and reconnaissance, hinted at his suitability for military service in roles that required quick thinking and coordination.

On February 14, 1941, at the age of 20, Ronald enlisted in the Canadian Army in Ottawa. Motivated by a desire to be with his friends and contribute to the war effort, he joined District Depot “A” Military District No. 3. Prior to his enlistment, he had served with the 25th Field Battery, 1st Field Brigade, Royal Canadian Artillery (Reserve Force), gaining valuable military experience.

Ronald’s military service began in Canada from February 13, 1941, to June 19, 1941. He was then deployed to the United Kingdom on June 20, 1941, where he served until August 16, 1943. During his time in the UK, he honed his skills and expressed a keen interest in signaling, aspiring to become a reconnaissance signaller. His dedication and aptitude led to his assignment with the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (4th PLDG), a regiment of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps.

On August 17, 1943, Ronald arrived in Italy as part of the Italian Campaign—a crucial series of Allied operations aimed at liberating Italy from Axis forces. Serving in a challenging environment, he demonstrated bravery and commitment to his duties. His role required not only physical endurance but also mental acuity, as signaling and reconnaissance were vital to the success of military operations.

Tragically, Lance Corporal Ronald Walter O’Brien was killed in action on January 11, 1945, at the age of 22. His death was a profound loss to his family, especially his mother Elsie and his siblings. His father, serving overseas in England, shared the grief from afar. Ronald was laid to rest at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot I, Row B, Grave 2.

Remembered for his courage and dedication, Lance Corporal O’Brien embodied the spirit of young Canadians who left their homes to serve alongside their friends in the face of global conflict. His story highlights the personal sacrifices made by so many during World War II and serves as a lasting tribute to the bravery of those who fought for freedom.
