<br>


Private Edward Postlethwaite, a member of the Cape Breton Highlanders of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps (R.C.I.C.), gave his life in service to his country on December 13, 1944, in Italy. 
He is commemorated at the Villanova War Cemetery, where he rests in Plot VII, Row B, Grave 6.

Edward was born on May 11, 1912, in Sydney, Nova Scotia. Growing up in a close-knit family, he was one of seven children born to James and Maria Postlethwaite, alongside his brothers William, James, Eric, and John, and his sisters Elizabeth and Helen. He shared a sense of community and duty with his family, particularly his brother William, who also served in the military as a member of the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps. Edward’s life in Sydney revolved around his family and the strong sense of duty he carried into adulthood. His early interests included hunting, fishing, swimming, and playing softball, where he enjoyed playing center field.

Edward completed grade 7 before entering the workforce, gaining steady employment as a pipe fitter’s helper with the Iron and Steel Company in Sydney, where he earned $26 per week. Working as a fitter’s helper provided Edward with skills he valued, and he planned to continue in this role upon his return after the war. By the time he enlisted, he had also gained some experience as an ironworker, giving him practical knowledge that would later aid him in military duties. Although he began specialized training in radio communication, he did not complete the full course.

Edward married his wife, Mary, and together they had three children: Bernard Edward, Jean Elizabeth, and a daughter, Diane, born on July 15, 1942. Their young family lived in South Bar, Nova Scotia, where Edward was known as a stable, friendly, and unassuming man, though he showed determination when it came to his work and family.

On July 14, 1941, Edward enlisted in Sydney, Nova Scotia, with a deep sense of duty and the desire to serve in the face of a global conflict. 
He first served within Canada before being transferred to the United Kingdom in March 1942, where he continued training and duty assignments with the Cape Breton Highlanders. His time in the UK lasted until October 1943, when he embarked for Italy to join the frontlines of the Italian Campaign. 
His experience as a pipe fitter and ironworker gave him the mechanical skills that were highly valued in the field, and his superiors regarded him as a reliable, sturdy soldier.

By the end of 1944, Edward’s regiment was engaged in the brutal fighting near the Lamone River in Italy, where they faced relentless enemy resistance. 
It was during these operations, on December 13, 1944, that Edward was killed in action. His sacrifice left a lasting impact on his family, friends, and community, and his memory has endured as a symbol of courage and dedication.

Private Edward Postlethwaite’s life, marked by a commitment to his family and country, remains a proud legacy within the history of the Cape Breton Highlanders. His quiet, strong character is remembered not only in the cemetery where he rests but also in the hearts of those who continue to honor his sacrifice.
