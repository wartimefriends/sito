Born on October 15, 1920, in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia, Andrew grew up in a large and supportive family. He was the third of six children born to Alexander and Effie Bonnar, alongside his brothers Stanley and Clarence, and sisters Catherine (Finnigan) and Rachael. Additionally, he had four step-siblings: Mrs. Daniel MacMullin, Mrs. John Fifoot, George Gardner, and Joseph Gardner.

Andrew attended Notre Dame School and the Immaculate Conception in Sydney Mines, completing Grade 8 before entering the workforce. 
Described as earnest and dependable, Andrew worked as a clerk at J. McIntyre’s grocery and confectionary store from July 1937 to January 1940, earning a modest $3 per week. Despite his limited income, Andrew developed a strong work ethic and a sense of responsibility. His hobbies included swimming, skating, and playing hockey as a left wing and baseball as a right fielder, showcasing his active and sociable nature.

At 5’7” tall and weighing 137 pounds, Andrew was described as neat in appearance, correct in deportment, and earnest in disposition. With hazel eyes, blonde hair, and a fair complexion, he carried himself with pride and dignity. 
His military evaluations noted his satisfactory knowledge of map reading and mechanics, as well as his potential to become a good soldier.

Motivated by a desire to “see a bit of the world,” Andrew enlisted in the Canadian Army on January 15, 1940, in Sydney, Nova Scotia. He joined the Cape Breton Highlanders, a regiment deeply rooted in his community and known for its courage and tenacity. After initial training in Canada, Andrew was deployed to the United Kingdom in November 1941, where he prepared for the challenges of war.

In October 1943, Andrew was sent to Italy as part of the Allied effort to liberate the country from Axis forces. The Italian Campaign was one of the most grueling theaters of the war, testing soldiers with harsh terrain, relentless combat, and adverse weather conditions. Despite these challenges, Andrew served with distinction as a Private and Bren Gunner in his regiment.

Tragically, Andrew’s service came to an end on December 13, 1944, during intense combat near Villanova, Italy. He was 24 years old. 
His death was a profound loss to his family and community, who remembered him as a devoted son, brother, and friend.

Private Andrew Bonnar was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot VII, Row B, Grave 1. His grave stands as a lasting tribute to his courage, sacrifice, and unwavering dedication to his country.

Andrew’s story is one of determination, service, and sacrifice. From his humble beginnings in Sydney Mines to the battlefields of Italy, he embodied the spirit of duty and resilience that defined his generation. His memory lives on in the hearts of his family, his community, and the history of the Cape Breton Highlanders. 
Private Andrew Bonnar’s legacy serves as a poignant reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices made by ordinary individuals in the pursuit of freedom and peace.
