title = "John Gordon LEONARD, known fondly as “Jackie” among family and friends, was a young man of strong character and quiet dedication."
+++

Born on February 24, 1919, in Carman, Manitoba, and raised in nearby Sperling, he was part of a large family with five brothers—Roy, Henry, Alfred, Donald, and James—and seven sisters: Kathryn, Dorothy, Marie, Betty, Vera, Phyllis, and Roseann. As the fifth child in a household of thirteen, John grew up with a deep sense of family and community, sharing in the daily responsibilities of rural life.

With only a Grade 3 education, John spent his youth working on the family farm, developing an affinity for farm machinery and learning the skills needed to handle vehicles of all types, including light trucks, farm tractors, and even tracked vehicles. Known for his helpful nature, John often pitched in to support neighboring farms during the busy harvest seasons, becoming a trusted and valued member of his community. Despite his limited schooling, he was naturally inclined toward mechanics, though his main interest was in driving, a skill that eventually led him to work as a truck driver.

At the age of 23, on April 22, 1942, John enlisted in the Canadian Army in Victoria, British Columbia, driven by a sense of duty and commitment. Though initially called up under the National Resources Mobilization Act (NRMA), John chose to go active, joining the Victoria Rifles and training in infantry roles. His military superiors recognized his potential for leadership, noting his well-built frame, tanned complexion, and neat appearance. At 5 feet 7 inches and 174 pounds, with brown eyes and black hair, John had a steady presence that marked him as someone capable of shouldering responsibility, though he was considered quiet and unassuming.

Following his training, John’s service took him through Canada, the United Kingdom, and ultimately Italy, where he was deployed on October 27, 1943. In the harsh conditions of the Italian front, John proved his resilience and adaptability. His experience with farm machinery and vehicles likely served him well, as he navigated the varied landscapes and challenges posed by the war. Although he had endured fractures to his left arm and right leg as a child, he maintained a reasonable attitude toward his health and remained physically fit for service.

Away from the front lines, John had simple enjoyments. He liked reading, particularly love story magazines, and he found relaxation in fishing and hunting, pursuits that connected him to his rural roots. He was also an avid baseball fan, often playing first base in local games, and he appreciated the occasional drink and smoke, finding solace in these small comforts amid the demands of service life.

Tragically, John’s journey ended on December 20, 1944, in Italy, where he was killed in action at the Fosso Munio. 
He rests at the Villanova War Cemetery Plot IV Row A, Grave 6.  
For his family and the farming community of Sperling, Manitoba, the loss of “Jackie” was profound. He had been a kind-hearted and reliable presence, always willing to lend a hand, whether to his large family or to the neighboring farmers who relied on him during harvest. Though he may have been young and unassuming, John’s legacy endures as a testament to quiet strength, resilience, and selfless service.

Today, his memory lives on as a symbol of courage and dedication, honored among those who made the ultimate sacrifice for a cause greater than themselves.
