<br>


Sergeant John Campbell Reid, a young soldier of the Cape Breton Highlanders, served his country with steadfast commitment and courage until his untimely death on January 3, 1945, at age 21. 
He is remembered and honored in Plot II, Row C, Grave 6, at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy.

Born on July 29, 1921, in Toronto, Ontario, John was the oldest of two sons of Robert Hamilton and Elizabeth Reid. Raised in a family with a deep sense of duty and community, John attended Eastern High School, where he completed a commercial course that prepared him for a career in clerical work. Before the war, he worked for Massey-Harris, earning $10 a week, a modest income that reflected the economic challenges of the era. Though his primary job was as a clerk, John had also spent time fruit farming in Ontario, gaining practical experience in physical labor. He was an active young man with a love for sports, especially track and field, hockey, and boxing, and he enjoyed playing left wing for his local hockey team. A member of the swimming club, John appreciated both the skill and discipline that sports demanded.

At just 18, John felt a calling to serve his country and enlisted on July 18, 1940, in Toronto. He joined the 2nd Canadian Motorcycle Regiment (Governor General’s Horse Guards) as part of the Canadian Active Service Force (CASF). A clean-cut young man with a dark complexion, blue eyes, and dark brown hair, he stood at 5’9” and weighed 140 pounds. John’s determination was evident from the start; he attended specialized courses, qualifying as a signaller and gunner. His enthusiasm and skill did not go unnoticed by his superiors, who noted his ambition to join a Highland or Scottish regiment. Eventually, his transfer to the Cape Breton Highlanders was secured on May 18, 1942.

For John, military service was more than a duty—it was a passion. His ultimate goal was to join the Commandos, a force he greatly admired for their rigorous training and elite status. As he honed his skills, his superiors recommended him as a strong candidate for commando training. 
Despite his intense focus on the war effort, John also harbored dreams of returning home to join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), a role that he saw as both honorable and challenging.

John’s military journey took him from training in Canada to deployments in the United Kingdom, where he served from October 1941 until October 1943. 
In October 1943, he was deployed to Italy, where he joined Allied forces in some of the war’s fiercest battles. He was temporarily hospitalized in May 1944 after being wounded but returned to his unit shortly afterward. His bravery and dedication were recognized on December 17, 1944, when he was promoted to sergeant, marking a significant achievement in his military career.

Tragically, John’s journey was cut short on January 3, 1945, during a mission in Italy, where he was killed in action. 
Though his life ended far from home, his legacy endures as a testament to his dedication and sacrifice. His family, friends, and comrades remember him as a brave and driven young man who dreamed of a life in service to his country, first as a soldier and later as a Mountie.

Sergeant John Campbell Reid’s service remains a proud part of his family’s history and a symbol of the courage that defined his generation. His memory lives on among those who honor the sacrifices made by the young men and women of the Cape Breton Highlanders and the many others who gave their lives during World War II.
