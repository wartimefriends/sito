George Paxton Glenday’s life is a testament to reliability, dedication, and quiet strength, reflecting the qualities of a man who served his country with distinction during the Second World War. 
Born on July 10, 1911, in Montreal, Quebec, George grew up in a large and supportive family. He was the fourth of eleven children born to Alexander Gordon and Isabella M.S. Glenday, with nine sisters—Isabel, Jean, Irene, Edith, Winnifred, Margaret, Alexandra, Edna, and Pearl—and a brother, Alexander, who also served in the Canadian Army Dental Corps.

George’s early years were shaped by the challenges and opportunities of life in a large family. He left school at the age of 14, having completed Grade VIII, to begin his career. From 1926 to 1941, he worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway in Montreal as a payroll clerk, statistical clerk, and timekeeper, earning $25 a week. He briefly took on a more technical role as an aircraft bomb inspector for Canadian Car & Munitions Ltd. in Montreal, where he earned $30 a week.

Described as neat, smart, and above average in intelligence, George was known for his sturdy build, blue eyes, and calm demeanor. At 5’7” and 168 pounds, he was a reliable and capable individual, noted for his quiet, businesslike attitude and dependable nature. His hobbies included reading works of fiction by authors like Lloyd C. Douglas, as well as participating in sports such as basketball, baseball, softball, cricket, golf, and hunting. George’s involvement in team sports highlighted his cooperative spirit and ability to work well with others, traits that would serve him well in the military.

On November 18, 1941, George enlisted in the Canadian Army in Montreal, motivated in part by seeing many of his friends join the service. He brought prior military experience to his enlistment, having served with the 2nd Battalion Royal Montreal Regiment (R.M.R.) from 1932 to 1935 and the Victoria Rifles of Canada (Reserve Force) from July 1940 onward. His Army superiors quickly recognized his leadership potential, noting his ambition to qualify as a sergeant through further training at an NCO school.

George’s military journey began in Canada, where he served for just over a year before being deployed to the United Kingdom in December 1942. 
By August 1943, he was stationed in Italy as part of the Italian Campaign, a grueling and pivotal series of battles aimed at liberating Italy from Axis control. In July 1944, George transferred to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (PLDG), a reconnaissance regiment that played a critical role in the campaign.

The Italian Campaign was characterized by harsh terrain, intense enemy resistance, and high casualty rates. George and his regiment faced relentless challenges as they advanced through Italian towns and countryside, engaging in dangerous reconnaissance missions and clearing key strategic positions.

Tragically, on December 13, 1944, Lance Corporal George Paxton Glenday was killed in action during operations near Villanova, Italy. His sacrifice came during a period of fierce combat as Allied forces sought to gain control over vital areas. George was just 33 years old.

George was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot II, Row A, Grave 9. His grave serves as a solemn reminder of his courage and the ultimate sacrifice he made in the fight for freedom.

Lance Corporal George Paxton Glenday’s story is one of quiet heroism and unwavering dedication. From his early years as a hardworking clerk in Montreal to his service on the battlefields of Italy, George exemplified the values of reliability, cooperation, and selflessness. 
Though his life was tragically cut short, his legacy endures as a testament to the sacrifices made by so many in the pursuit of peace and freedom.
