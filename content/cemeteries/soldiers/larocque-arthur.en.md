title = "Private Arthur LAROCQUE, a member of the Royal 22e Régiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, was a humble and dedicated soldier who served his country with quiet resolve. Born on April 24, 1922, in Eastview, Ontario, Arthur was raised in a large family with deep-rooted ties. His father, Albert, and mother, Celina, provided for their family as best they could, but when Celina passed away in 1933, Arthur, along with his siblings—Albert, Hector, Paul, Celina, Irene, Cecile, Alice, and Thérèse—faced a challenging upbringing."

Arthur completed Grade 6 before leaving school at the age of 15. Despite his limited formal education, he quickly developed a solid work ethic, securing employment in a local Ottawa restaurant. Starting as a waiter, he eventually took on responsibilities as a cook, working for two and a half years before enlisting.
Known for his practical skills, Arthur aspired to work as a machinist in the future, a testament to his steady ambitions and adaptability.

On October 12, 1941, Arthur enlisted in the Canadian Army in Ottawa. Assigned to the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (R.C.O.C.), he underwent basic training and was initially given general duties overseas after being deployed in March 1942. Arthur’s small frame—standing at 5 feet 4 inches and weighing just 120 pounds—belied his resilience and determination. 
While he was shy and somewhat reserved, he possessed a quiet strength that served him well in the often-demanding role of an infantryman. Described as bilingual and fluent in both French and English, he was comfortable navigating the bilingual needs of his unit, though his shyness made him somewhat reluctant in conversation.

Arthur’s service took him to the United Kingdom, where he spent two years in various postings, including six months working in a tool room at a workshop, gaining practical experience in technical tasks. His performance was steady, though he was ultimately recommended for non-specialized duties in the infantry. In September 1944, he was transferred to Italy, joining the Royal 22e Régiment, known as the “Van Doos,” a storied regiment with a rich history of service.

In Italy, Arthur participated in the intense and challenging Italian Campaign. Facing treacherous conditions and fierce opposition, he displayed a resilience characteristic of his regiment, adapting to the demands of combat despite his quiet nature. Tragically, on December 15, 1944, Arthur was killed in action near Russi, Italy, just two days after formally joining the Royal 22e Régiment. 
His initial burial was located North-West of Russi, outside the civil cemetery, marking the place where he fell in service to his country.

Private Arthur Larocque was later interred at Villanova War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot I, Row C, Grave 1. His life and sacrifice remain a testament to the courage and commitment of young men who served in the face of overwhelming odds. Remembered for his humility, quiet strength, and unwavering dedication, Arthur’s story is one of resilience and loyalty, honoring his memory and the sacrifices he made far from his Canadian home.
