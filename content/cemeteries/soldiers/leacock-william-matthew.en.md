William Matthew Leacock was born on November 20, 1920, in Lorneville, Ontario, into a family marked by hardship. His father, Matthew, passed away before William was born, and his mother, Mary Elizabeth, died in 1934 when he was just a boy. Despite these early losses, William grew up with the support of his sisters, Mary Jane (Minnie) Harper and Elizabeth (Lizzie) Ashmore, both of whom married and started families of their own. Another sister, Alice, and his brother, Robert, had already passed away, adding to the challenges he faced in his early life.

William completed Grade 8 in Ontario, leaving school to work on farms to support himself and gain practical skills. For six years, he worked in mixed and dairy farming, where he learned to drive tractors and trucks, as well as perform minor repairs on car motors. 
His employer at the time of his enlistment, W.C. Milne of Langstaff, Ontario, valued his work ethic and reliability. Quiet and soft-spoken, William expressed a desire to continue farming after the war or pursue a career as a truck driver or factory worker.

At 5’8” and 140 pounds, William was described as healthy, well-built, and pleasant. His assessors noted his average learning ability, cooperative nature, and polite demeanor. Although he lacked a flashy appearance, he had a sound outlook on life and a responsible approach to work and responsibilities. He maintained a spotless five-year driving record, demonstrating his careful and reliable nature.

On February 25, 1943, William enlisted in the Canadian Army in Toronto, Ontario, joining the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps. He was motivated by a sense of duty, despite the difficulties of adjusting to the routine of army life. His early service included training in Canada before deployment to the United Kingdom on August 27, 1943. By March 28, 1944, he had arrived in Italy, where he joined the grueling Italian Campaign.

William faced challenges as a soldier, particularly on the rifle range, where he struggled to achieve good scores. Despite this, he remained cooperative and determined to overcome his difficulties. His superiors recognized his potential as a motor transport driver, given his extensive experience with trucks and tractors, and noted his steady progress as a soldier.

Tragically, William’s service ended on January 2, 1945, when he was killed in action in Italy at the age of 24. 
He was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery, where his grave in Plot I, Row A, Grave 8 stands as a testament to his sacrifice.

William’s life was one of quiet perseverance, shaped by hardship and marked by dedication to his family and country. Despite his modest beginnings and personal challenges, he remained committed to his duty, earning respect for his determination and reliability. His memory endures as a symbol of the strength and courage of ordinary individuals who gave their lives in the pursuit of freedom.
