Tragically, Raymond was killed in action on December 20, 1944, during the Italian Campaign, a part of the Allies’ effort to push the Axis forces out of Italy. He is buried in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, Plot IV, Row C, Grave 5.

At the time of his enlistment, Raymond was 18 years old, standing 5’7” and weighing 124 pounds. He had a youthful energy and enthusiasm, with dreams of becoming a paratrooper. He was married to Violet May Vince, and they had a son, Allan David, born in April 1944, just a few months before Raymond was deployed overseas. His wife and child resided in Simcoe, Ontario. Raymond came from a large family, with two brothers, James and John, and six sisters: Margaret June, Marion Rose, Florence Adamay, Lena Katharine, Jean Ruth, and Ruby Marie. His parents were Fred and Ethel Vince, and they lived in Parry Sound, Ontario, near Otter Lake Station.

Raymond’s background was modest. He completed Grade 7 in rural Ontario and left school at 14 years old. After leaving school, he worked various jobs, including helping on his family farm, working in a clothing mill, and in various industries, including aeroplane body manufacturing, iron melting, and munitions at Cockshutt Co. in Brantford, Ontario. Just before his enlistment, he had been cutting logs in the bush for two months. Despite his restless work history, Raymond was interested in becoming a carpenter after the war, having dabbled in rough carpentry as a hobby.

In his military assessment, Raymond was noted as a man of average physical development with a pleasing appearance. Although somewhat restless, he was seen as willing, cooperative, and emotionally stable. He showed normal progress during his basic infantry training and was considered suitable for overseas service. In May 1944, he completed basic training and corps training in the infantry. His desire to serve as a paratrooper was supported by his wife, Violet May, and the Regimental Medical Officer found him suitable for paratrooper training, though he had a history of bone fractures that needed to be monitored.

Raymond was transferred to the Perth Regiment on September 9, 1944. He participated in the Italian Campaign, which was marked by intense fighting as Allied forces pushed through heavily defended German positions.

Raymond Joseph Vince’s life was tragically cut short at the young age of 19, leaving behind his wife, young son, and a grieving family. His service and sacrifice are remembered, and he lies at rest in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy.
