Born on October 3, 1908, in Sydney, Nova Scotia, he was 35 years old when he enlisted. Standing at 5’9¼” and weighing 158 lbs, Sydney had a dark complexion, hazel eyes, and black hair. His religious affiliation was with the United Church, and he was single at the time of his enlistment.

Sydney came from a large family. His father, Hubert Wilfred, and his mother, Barbara Alice, raised a family that included his brothers Albert Howard, Edward, Arthur, Samuel, and Arnold, and his sisters Thelma, Mildred, and Evelyn. Sydney was one of nine children.

He completed his education up to the ninth grade, leaving school at the age of 16.
He attended the Academy for two years, where he began a career in Athletics which was to make him known as one of the outstanding athletes of Eastern Canada. He was proficient in almost every sport, and in character and conduct he set up a worthy example for young athletes.
 He then began working, spending four years with Irving Oil Ltd. before enlisting in the Army.
On December 11, 1942, Sydney enlisted in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Assigned initially to the No. 6 District Depot General List, he was later transferred to the Irish Regiment of Canada on October 2, 1944, in Italy.

Sydney served in several regions during his military career: he was stationed in Canada from December 11, 1942, to December 15, 1943, then served in the United Kingdom from December 16, 1943, to February 19, 1944. 
Following this, he was deployed to Italy, where he served from February 20, 1944, until January 2, 1945. He qualified as a signaler in the UK on September 17, 1943, after training with the 7th Canadian Infantry Reinforcement Unit.

Sydney was known to enjoy swimming and bowling. He played baseball as a center fielder, hockey as a center or right wing, and softball as a third baseman. He passed his trade test with above-average marks, was well-presented, had a strong work ethic, and was regarded as a willing and cooperative individual.
Sadly, Sydney was killed in action on January 2, 1945, during heavy shellfire near Mezzano, Italy. 
He was laid to rest at the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, with his grave located in Plot I, Row B, Grave 2.

Sydney’s memory is cherished by his family. Brewster, a relative, shared the following information through a website: “My husband’s grandmother passed away, and while we were cleaning the house, we found photos of Sydney Muggah. He had been dating my husband’s great-aunt Margaret, and they were planning to marry. We found letters he had written from overseas, including one sent just two days before his death.”
