Private Miro George Bartko was born on August 29, 1923, in Sokal, Saskatchewan (though his attestation papers suggest 1920). The son of Dmytro and Bessie Bartko, he grew up in a large family alongside his three brothers—William, Orest, and Walter—and four sisters—Emily, Jean, Anne Rose, and Sylvia. Raised in a close-knit farming community, 
Miro attended Dunwell School but left after completing Grade 8, setting out to work as a truck driver, a role he held for four years before enlisting.

Standing tall at 5’11”, with a dark complexion, brown eyes, and black hair, Miro presented a striking figure. Despite a minor vision impairment—he was cross-eyed and wore glasses—he carried himself with dignity and determination. A member of the Greek Catholic Church, Miro’s faith and strong work ethic shaped his outlook on life.

In April 1942, at the age of 19, Miro enlisted in Regina, Saskatchewan, joining the Canadian Army as part of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, R.C.I.C. 
His enlistment was a natural step for someone accustomed to hard work and duty. His military records reveal a man with ambition and drive, eager to contribute to the war effort and to broaden his horizons.

Miro’s early service saw him posted across several units, reflecting the army’s shifting needs during World War II. He underwent training with the 58th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery and the 35th Anti-Aircraft Troop before being transferred to the infantry. While he initially showed interest in advancing to specialized roles, including training for the 6-pounder course, his assignments were continually redirected. His commanders consistently noted his strong spirit, satisfactory progress, and suitability for overseas service.

On August 31, 1944, Miro was deployed to the United Kingdom, where he underwent additional training. 
By September 29, 1944, he was in Italy, part of the Allied forces engaged in the grueling Italian Campaign. Miro’s final assignment placed him with the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, a unit tasked with some of the most intense and dangerous operations in the region.

On December 14, 1944, Miro was killed in action during operations near the Senio River, a focal point in the Allied advance through northern Italy. 
He was just 21 years old. 
His loss was deeply felt by his family, who remembered him as a hardworking, ambitious young man with dreams of a better future after the war.

Miro was laid to rest with honor at the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot VI, Row B, Grave 8. His grave stands as a solemn tribute to his bravery and the ultimate sacrifice he made for his country.

Miro’s story reflects the profound sacrifices made by young Canadians during World War II. From his early life on the family farm to his service in the Canadian Army, he exemplified the values of hard work, perseverance, and loyalty. 
Though his life was tragically short, Miro George Bartko’s legacy endures in the memories of his family and in the annals of Canadian military history—a young man who gave his all for a cause greater than himself.
