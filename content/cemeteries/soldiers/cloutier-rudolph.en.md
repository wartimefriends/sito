Sergeant Rudolph Cloutier was born on October 18, 1920, in Tilbury, Ontario, to parents Philias and Mary Cloutier. He grew up in a close-knit family alongside his brothers Edgar and Raymond, and his sister Jeannette, who tragically passed away in May 1935. The family lived on Poplar Street in Tilbury, where Rudolph attended St. Francis School. Raised in the Roman Catholic faith, he was deeply rooted in the Tilbury community.

Rudolph left school after completing Grade 8 and entered the workforce at an early age. He was a truck driver for Hudson Motors from 1936 to 1939, earning a weekly wage of $20.00. He also worked briefly for the Michigan Central Railway in the United States, where he was involved in railroading and earned $25.00 weekly. He eventually returned to truck driving at Hudson Motors, and when he enlisted in the Canadian Army, he expressed an interest in pursuing a career in mechanics.

On January 13, 1940, at the age of 19, Rudolph enlisted in the Royal Canadian Regiment (R.C.R.) in London, Ontario. Like many young men of his generation, Rudolph felt the call to serve his country during the early days of World War II. 
He embarked on a long and committed military journey, beginning with his initial service in Canada from January 13, 1940, to May 12, 1940. From there, he was deployed to the United Kingdom, where he served until June 13, 1943. In June 1943, Rudolph joined the fight in the grueling Italian Campaign, which would ultimately claim his life.

During his military service, Rudolph’s dedication was evident. He completed various training courses, including a Boxing Instructor’s Course, and was at one point qualified as a Cook (Group “C”). However, by March 1943, he ceased to serve in this role. At some point during his service in the UK, Rudolph was granted permission to marry in May 1942, though by the time of his death, he remained unmarried.

Rudolph had a notable athletic background, excelling in boxing, as well as playing baseball (where he was a pitcher) and rugby (where he played half-back). He also had a musical talent, playing the harmonica.

Physically, Rudolph was 5’ 7” tall, weighed 168 pounds, and had dark brown hair, brown eyes, and a medium complexion. He bore a distinctive ½-inch scar on his left cheek, but otherwise, his military evaluations consistently described him as having a clean, neat appearance. His superiors noted his acceptable deportment, disposition, and military and mechanical knowledge.

Rudolph’s service in the Italian Campaign would be his last. 
On December 5, 1944, at the age of 24, Sergeant Rudolph Cloutier was killed in action in Italy. His family in Tilbury, including his parents and brothers, received the tragic news from the Minister of National Defence, confirming that Rudolph, previously listed as missing, was now officially reported killed in action. The heartbreak was especially poignant given that Sgt. Raymond Cloutier, Rudolph’s brother, was also serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force at the time.

A requiem mass was held in Rudolph’s memory at St. Francis R.C. Church in Tilbury. The mass was led by Rev. A. J. McNabb, with Rev. Father Chevalier and Rev. L. L. Ouellette serving as deacon and sub-deacon. Many in the community, including representatives of the Canadian Legion, the Tilbury Company of the Second Kents, and the Tilbury Lions Air Squadron, came together to honor Rudolph’s memory. Comrade John Lovis sounded the Last Post and Reveille as the congregation solemnly receded from the church.

Sergeant Rudolph Cloutier’s sacrifice is memorialized at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he lies in Plot  I - C - 4. 
His story, like so many others from that time, is a testament to the bravery, dedication, and ultimate sacrifice of Canadian soldiers during World War II. 
His legacy lives on in the hearts of his family, community, and country.
