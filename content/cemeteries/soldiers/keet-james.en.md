<br>


James Keet was born on August 1, 1920, in Warwickshire, England, to Robert and Beatrice Keet. The eldest of two children, James grew up with his younger sister Phyllis in a close-knit family. The Keet family emigrated to Canada, settling in New Westminster, British Columbia, where James spent most of his childhood. 
Described as fair-complexioned with blue eyes and light brown hair, James had a keen interest in sports and outdoor activities, excelling in swimming, running hurdles, and rowing. He also enjoyed team sports, playing basketball as a guard and softball as a shortstop.

James left school at 16, after completing one year of high school and a technical course at Trapp Tech. There, he gained specialized skills in machine shop work, drafting, woodwork, and sheet metal, preparing him for future employment. Though he had a desire to pursue a career in telegraphy, James initially worked as a greenkeeper at the Vancouver Golf and Country Club from 1937 to 1938, earning $25 per week. He later took up similar work at the Burquitlam Golf and Country Club in New Westminster before turning to odd jobs at a shingle mill, door mill, and as a painter.

James enlisted in the Canadian Army on June 24, 1940, in New Westminster, following the example of others who were joining the war effort. Assigned to the Westminster Regiment (Motorized) of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, he began his military career as part of “C” Company. His early service involved rigorous training in Canada until November 10, 1941, when he was deployed to the United Kingdom. For two years, he served in the UK, further honing his skills and preparing for combat.

In November 1943, James was sent to Italy as part of the grueling Italian Campaign. The campaign was one of the most challenging theatres of World War II, demanding physical endurance, tactical expertise, and unyielding courage. During his time in Italy, James demonstrated strong leadership qualities, earning the rank of sergeant. Though described as having a somewhat poor memory, he was noted for his intelligence, cooperative nature, and clean-cut demeanor, qualities that made him a respected figure among his peers.

Tragically, Sergeant James Keet was killed in action on December 14, 1944, during combat in Italy. His service and sacrifice are commemorated at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot VII, Row B, Grave 10.

James Keet’s life reflects a journey of service, resilience, and dedication. From his early years in England to his contributions on the battlefield, he lived with a sense of purpose and commitment to his comrades and country. 
His memory endures as a symbol of the courage and sacrifice of those who gave their lives in the fight for freedom.
