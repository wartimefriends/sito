Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment -  R.C.I.C.

Born on November 23, 1916, in Owen Sound, Ontario, Douglas Lloyd grew up in a modest family of six siblings. Raised in the Church of England, Douglas was known for his fair complexion, blue eyes, and brown hair. At 5’10½” and 147 pounds, he was a sturdy and capable young man with a passion for mechanics and a knack for hard work.

Douglas completed Grade 10 before leaving school at the age of 19 to pursue an apprenticeship in auto mechanics. He successfully completed the program, showcasing a natural aptitude for working with engines. His skills extended beyond mechanics; Douglas also worked as a carpenter for Panel Door Co. in Toronto for two years, crafting finely finished doors. For a time, he was a truck driver for a salt works in Sarnia, gaining experience on the road. 
Despite his varied career, Douglas sought something beyond the confines of his everyday work—he yearned for adventure.

On January 17, 1940, at the age of 23, Douglas enlisted in the Canadian military in London, Ontario, joining the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment under the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps (RCIC). 
He saw the military as a path to new challenges and opportunities, a sentiment echoed during his enlistment interview where he expressed no desire to return to his previous jobs after the war. His enthusiasm, conscientious nature, and steadiness left a strong impression on his interviewers, who saw in him the qualities of a non-commissioned officer.

Douglas’s military career took him across continents and into the heart of World War II. After initial training in Canada, he departed for the United Kingdom on May 13, 1940. There, he honed his skills as a dispatch rider and motorcycle instructor, becoming qualified in April 1942. His love for engines and mechanics made him excel in these roles, and he quickly became an invaluable member of his unit. Douglas’s dedication was evident not only in his technical expertise but also in his willingness to take on any task, no matter how challenging.

In June 1943, Douglas’s service took him to Italy as part of the Allied campaign to push back Axis forces. He served on the frontlines with courage and determination, embodying the resilience of the Canadian soldiers who fought in the difficult Italian terrain.

Beyond the battlefield, Douglas’s character shone through in quieter moments. He enjoyed swimming, hunting, and skating, finding solace in activities that reminded him of home. His passion for engines remained a constant, a link to the life he had temporarily set aside for the war effort.

Tragically, Private Douglas Lloyd’s journey ended on December 6, 1944, when he was killed in action at the age of 28. He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot 1, Row C, Grave 2.
His sacrifice was part of the larger effort to secure freedom during one of the most challenging periods in history. He left behind his parents, Walter James and Maud Lillias, his brother George Edwin, and four sisters: Sarah Jane Elizabeth, Gladys Lillian, Muriel Edith, and Myrtle Florence. Two of his sisters lived in the United States, highlighting the international ties of his close-knit family.

Private Douglas Lloyd is remembered not just as a soldier but as a young man who gave everything for a cause greater than himself. His story is one of dedication, service, and sacrifice—a legacy that lives on in the memories of his family and the history of his nation.
