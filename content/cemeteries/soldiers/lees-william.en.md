+++


Private William Lees, Service Number H100646, served with the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. 
Born on February 15, 1917, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, William lived a life marked by quiet dedication and responsibility. His father, William Sr., passed away when he was young, leaving William as the sole support for his mother, Clara. With no siblings, William shouldered the weight of family responsibilities early in life.

William attended school until Grade 9, completing part of Grade 10 before leaving at 17 to enter the workforce. His first job was as a grocery store clerk at Goodman’s Grocery in Winnipeg, where he worked for six years. Later, he found employment as a warehouse shipper’s helper and assistant shipper for Walter Woods Ltd., a wholesale hardware company. Known for his reliability and pleasant demeanor, William was promised a position at Walter Woods upon his return from the war, with aspirations to work as a freight checker for the Canadian National Railway (C.N.R.).

Standing 5’10” and weighing 137 pounds, with dark hair, hazel eyes, and a clean-cut appearance, William was described as personable and well-liked by his peers. He enjoyed swimming, bicycle racing, bowling, and collecting stamps, hobbies that reflected his thoughtful and active personality. Despite his average mechanical aptitude, his cooperative attitude and dependable nature made him a valued member of his community and later his regiment.

On April 22, 1942, William enlisted in Winnipeg, motivated by the expectation of being called up for service. After a brief two-month stint in the navy, where he served as an Ordinary Seaman, he transitioned to the Canadian Army. He trained at Fort Garry, Manitoba, and St. Johns, Nova Scotia, before being deployed to the United Kingdom on August 9, 1942. He spent over two years in the UK, honing his skills and preparing for combat, before being sent to Italy on September 29, 1944.

William’s time in Italy was brief but intense. Joining the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards in December 1944, he faced the relentless challenges of the Italian Campaign. This campaign, known for its grueling conditions and fierce combat, demanded resilience and courage from every soldier. Despite his limited time with the regiment, William demonstrated the dependability and quiet determination that had defined his life.

On December 15, 1944, Private William Lees was killed in action at the age of 27. 
He was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where his grave in Plot I, Row A, Grave 8 honors his sacrifice.

William’s medals, returned undelivered after the war, reflect a poignant detail of his story: his mother had returned to England, leaving behind the home he had supported with his dedication and hard work.

Private William Lees embodied the values of responsibility, service, and sacrifice. From his early years providing for his mother to his ultimate sacrifice on the battlefield, William’s life is a testament to the quiet heroism of ordinary men who gave everything in the name of duty. 
His memory lives on in the annals of history and in the hearts of those who recognize his courage and commitment.
