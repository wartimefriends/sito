<br>



Born on February 11, 1912, in Edmonton, Alberta, Toddy Eli Bodnaruk was a man of discipline, courage, and commitment. Standing 5’8½” tall and weighing 185 pounds, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and a medium complexion, Toddy embodied the strength and determination that defined his life. A devoted family man, he was married to Agnes Caroline and was the proud father of a son, Jack, and a daughter, Gwen.

Toddy’s upbringing instilled in him a strong work ethic. After completing 2½ years of high school, he began working for the Northern Alberta Railways in the Dunvegan Yards, a job he found fulfilling and hoped to return to after the war. His employer’s promise of continued employment reflects the respect and trust Toddy earned through his diligent work in the railway’s Car Department.

Toddy’s connection to the military began long before his enlistment in World War II. At the young age of 14, he joined the 13th Battalion Canadian Machine Gun Corps (C.M.G.C.), dedicating a decade to training before transitioning to the Edmonton Fusiliers in 1936. His extensive experience in the active militia spanned over 13½ years by the time he enlisted in the Canadian military on March 25, 1940, in Edmonton, Alberta. With this deep background, Toddy quickly rose through the ranks, achieving the position of Company Sergeant Major (C.S.M.) with the Edmonton Fusiliers.

Toddy’s formal commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Infantry Machine Gun Corps came on January 16, 1943, and he further advanced to Lieutenant in March of that year. 
His leadership skills were complemented by an impressive array of qualifications, including Driver Class III and wheeled/motorcycle training, as well as specialized courses in hygiene, sanitation, and reconnaissance. His promotion to Lieutenant with the Reconnaissance Corps (RECCE) of the Canadian Armoured Corps in October 1943 showcased his versatility and readiness for any mission.

Toddy served in Canada until July 1944, when he was deployed to the United Kingdom. His time in the UK was brief, and by September 1944, he was in Italy, where the brutal realities of frontline combat awaited him. 
Despite the dangers, Toddy remained steadfast in his duties, even when wounded on December 19, 1944. Refusing to step back, he continued to lead, a testament to his unwavering dedication to his comrades and his mission.

On January 2, 1945, Lieutenant Toddy Eli Bodnaruk was killed in action at the Senio River, Masiera, in Italy. 
His death marked the end of a life characterized by service—to his family, his community, and his country. Toddy’s tattoos, etched on both forearms, were a symbol of his individuality, but his actions and sacrifices defined his legacy.

Today, Lieutenant Bodnaruk is remembered not only as a skilled soldier and leader but also as a devoted husband and father who gave his all for the greater good. His courage, leadership, and loyalty to his fellow soldiers are emblematic of the sacrifices made by so many during World War II. 
His story stands as a tribute to the resilience of the human spirit and the profound cost of freedom.

… Lieutenant was one of those square-built men. They made great farmers, miners. And steady-eddie officers.
And because I did not know him, I couldn't tell why he never smiled. Maybe he didn't see anything funny about war.
A Company rifleman, sweating and dishevelled, burst into the rcwn. "Mr. Bodnaruk's been hit, bad. And' so's one of our stretcher bearers! You got help" Kerr and Halls, moving in stops and stads, carried three stretchers up to Dog company.
…"Bodnaruk's had it," Kerr reported on their return, "never really made it to the dyke. Shrapnel …
