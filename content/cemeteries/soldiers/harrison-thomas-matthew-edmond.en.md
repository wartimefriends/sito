Private Thomas Matthew Edmond Harrison’s story is one of duty, sacrifice, and unyielding devotion to both his country and his family. 
Born on November 25, 1914, in Toronto, Ontario, Thomas grew up as the only child of Anne Sophia Harrison, who was widowed early in his life. His mother, suffering from a debilitating illness described as “creeping paralysis,” required constant care. Thomas, a devoted son, took on the responsibility of supporting and caring for her until his enlistment in the Canadian Active Service Force (CASF) during the Second World War.

Thomas attended Central Technical School in Toronto, where he completed grade 11 and part of grade 12 before leaving school to support his mother. He worked as a baker’s helper for seven years at Brown’s Bread Company Limited, providing a steady income for their household. Known for his strong work ethic, keen intelligence, and cooperative nature, Thomas was described as a man of superior character and an ambitious learner.

When Thomas was called up for military service, he enlisted on October 21, 1943, in Toronto. Though his enlistment presented challenges due to his mother’s deteriorating health, arrangements were made for her to move in with a friend, Mrs. Minnie Cattell, who assumed responsibility for her care. This allowed Thomas to fulfill his duty to his country, though the separation was a source of great concern to him.

Thomas began his military training with Number 2 District Depot in Canada, where he excelled, showing enthusiasm and a strong aptitude for learning. His ambition to become a radio technician after the war reflected his intellectual curiosity and drive. In July 1944, Thomas was deployed to the United Kingdom for further preparation before being sent to the Italian Campaign in November 1944.

Assigned to A Company of the Irish Regiment of Canada on December 21, 1944, Thomas joined the Allied forces in one of the most grueling theaters of the war. The Italian Campaign was marked by fierce resistance from German forces and harsh environmental conditions, demanding physical endurance and resilience from all who served.

Tragically, on December 24, 1944, Private Thomas Harrison was killed in action during operations along the Senio River in Italy. At just 30 years old, his life and service were cut short, leaving behind his ailing mother and a legacy of unwavering dedication. 
He was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot III, Row B, Grave 10. His grave serves as a solemn reminder of the cost of freedom and the sacrifices made by those who gave their lives in its pursuit.

Thomas’s story is one of quiet heroism, shaped by his love for his mother and his determination to contribute to the war effort. His intelligence, cooperative nature, and sense of responsibility exemplify the qualities of his generation. 
Though his life ended too soon, the memory of Private Thomas Matthew Edmond Harrison lives on, honoring his service and sacrifice for his country.
