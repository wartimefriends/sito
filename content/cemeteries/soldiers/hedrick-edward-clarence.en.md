Edward Clarence Hedrick’s story is one of commitment, perseverance, and sacrifice. Born on August 3, 1921, in Leamington, Ontario, Edward grew up in Blenheim, a small community where he was part of a large, loving family. His parents, Clifford and Bessie, raised Edward alongside his three brothers, Donald, William (Bill), and John (Jack), and his four sisters, Agnes Irene, Betty Jean, Doreen Ethel, and Caroline Jane. As the son of a printer and steam-fitter, Edward’s childhood was marked by normalcy and Scottish heritage, which influenced his values and character.

Edward was bright and eager, completing grade eight and part of grade nine by age 14. However, his education was cut short as he left school to help support his family during tough economic times. He took on various jobs, including working as a clerk in a grocery store, a carpenter’s helper, a road construction laborer, and a farmhand. Skilled and versatile, Edward even apprenticed as a painter for three years, and he hoped to pursue electrical or carpentry work after the war.

Beyond his work ethic, Edward had a rich array of hobbies and talents. He loved reading, stamp collecting, and outdoor activities like swimming, hunting, and fishing. He was also a talented athlete, playing center in hockey and pitching in baseball. His musical talents were equally impressive—he played the trumpet and served as a duty bugler in the military band during his service.

Edward enlisted in the Canadian Army on August 11, 1940, in Chatham, Ontario, joining the Kent Regiment of the Canadian Active Service Force. His motivation was clear: he believed it was his duty to serve his country. Standing 5’10” tall and weighing 160 pounds, Edward was a clean-cut young man of good appearance with blue eyes and a pleasant manner. Though he was noted as being of average ability, his ambition and desire to contribute were unmistakable.

During his time with the Kent Regiment, Edward demonstrated commitment to improving himself, even completing a bricklayer’s course in Vancouver. By April 1943, his military superiors recognized his neat appearance and ambition, suggesting he might have potential for a junior non-commissioned officer role, though there was some question about his leadership ability. Edward expressed frustration with the limited opportunities for advancement in the military band and desired to take on more significant roles in the infantry.

In May 1943, Edward was deployed overseas, beginning service in the United Kingdom before being transferred to the Perth Regiment in October. 
By October 1943, he was stationed in Italy as part of the grueling Italian Campaign. There, he and his regiment faced some of the harshest conditions and most intense combat of the Second World War.

On December 20, 1944, Edward Clarence Hedrick was killed in action during operations in Italy. He was just 21 years old. 
His sacrifice is honored at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in plot IV B 3. His grave, like so many others, serves as a solemn reminder of the human cost of war and the bravery of those who gave their lives.

Private Hedrick’s story is one of a young man who answered the call of duty, leaving behind a life full of promise and ambition to fight for a cause greater than himself. His memory endures in the hearts of his family, his community, and all who honor the sacrifices made by those who served.
