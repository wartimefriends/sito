Lance Corporal Alexander Antoniuk was born on February 19, 1924, in Vilna, Alberta, Canada. The son of John and Dora Antoniuk, Alex grew up on a farm with his five siblings. His early years were marked by hardship; he lost his father when he was just six years old. Three years later, his mother remarried, but the marriage ended in separation by the time Alex was twelve. Despite these challenges, Alex developed into a robust and earnest young man, deeply connected to the rural life of Alberta.

Alex completed Grade VIII at the age of 15 before leaving school to help on the family farm. 
Fluent in both English and Ukrainian, he had a natural aptitude for farming, with experience in mixed operations that made him confident in running a farm. However, his ambitions lay elsewhere. Alex dreamed of pursuing a career in mechanics or welding, hoping to enroll in a welding course after the war. His quiet demeanor and high intelligence earned him a reputation as a reserved yet determined individual.

Life on the farm also gave Alex a love for the outdoors. He enjoyed swimming, skating, hunting, and playing softball, where he excelled as an outfielder. These pursuits reflected his active and hardworking nature. 
At 5’9¼” tall and weighing 151.5 pounds, Alex had a sturdy frame and a fair complexion with grey-blue eyes and brown hair.

On March 2, 1942, at the age of 18, Alex enlisted in the Canadian Army. Motivated by a sense of duty and a desire for a different future, he joined the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, a regiment renowned for its resilience and courage. After completing his initial training in Canada, Alex was sent overseas to the United Kingdom in July 1942.


In August 1943, Alex arrived in Italy as part of the Allied Armies Italy (AAI). The campaign was grueling, marked by treacherous conditions and fierce resistance from German forces. Despite the challenges, Alex proved himself to be a capable and dependable soldier. He was promoted to Lance Corporal and continued to serve with distinction.

In October 1944, during a particularly intense period of fighting, Alex was wounded and spent two days recovering at a Canadian General Hospital. He returned to the frontlines but was hospitalized again in late October and early November for additional injuries. These setbacks, however, did not diminish his resolve. Alex remained steadfast in his commitment to his regiment and his comrades.

On December 31, 1944, Lance Corporal Antoniuk was killed in action during combat close to the Senio River, that became the site of relentless fighting as the Allies sought to break through German defensive lines. Alex’s death came at the end of a year of immense sacrifice and loss for his regiment, as they faced some of the most brutal conditions of the Italian Campaign.

Alex was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot II, Row A, Grave 8. 
His sacrifice, made at the age of 20, was a profound loss for his family and community. Though his life was tragically short, Alex’s legacy endures as a symbol of courage, determination, and the quiet heroism of those who fought in the shadow of great adversity.

His family, like so many others, bore the weight of war long after its conclusion. His brother George, who had also served and been wounded, survived the war but carried its scars for the rest of his life. George passed away at a relatively young age, his address at one point listed as the Colonel Belcher Hospital in Calgary, a facility for veterans.

Alexander Antoniuk’s story is one of resilience and determination. A young man who grew up in the quiet fields of Alberta, he traded the simplicity of farm life for the chaos of war, ultimately giving his life in service to his country. 
His hopes of becoming a welder and building a peaceful future were left unrealized, but his bravery and sacrifice remain a testament to the strength of character he carried into the battlefield.
