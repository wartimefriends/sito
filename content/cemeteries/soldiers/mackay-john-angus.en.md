#### Perth Regiment, R.C.I.C.
<br>


Corporal John Angus MackAY, a dedicated serviceman of the Perth Regiment, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, was born on November 16, 1912, in the small Ontario town of Seaforth. Raised by his father, William John Mackay, and mother, Laura, John grew up in a close-knit family with his three siblings—brother Donald and sisters Beth, Oga, and Helen. 
However, tragedy struck early; his mother, Laura, passed away in 1930, leaving young John, who was just eighteen, to navigate the challenges of a home broken by loss.

John spent much of his young adulthood working in Perth County, Ontario, where he gained hands-on experience in farming. Hired by J. Carnochan, he worked diligently as a farmhand for over seven years, learning the intricacies of mixed farming across the region. However, John’s aspirations extended beyond agriculture. With a clear goal of pursuing a career in electricity, he enrolled in the Coyne Electrical School in Chicago in early 1938, attending courses from January through April. Despite his background in farming, John was determined to build a new path for himself and, following the war, hoped to become a qualified electrician.

At the outbreak of World War II, John, a dedicated and capable worker, felt a profound duty to serve. He enlisted in the Canadian Army on September 23, 1939, in Stratford, Ontario, joining the Perth Regiment’s Machine Gun unit. Though his reason for enlistment was not formally recorded, his history of service with the Simcoe Foresters militia since 1930 suggests a longstanding sense of duty and commitment to his country. John entered the military with significant skills, from mechanical knowledge to expertise in driving tractors and automobiles, all assets that made him a reliable and adaptable soldier. With a preference to serve as a Crew Commander for Armored Fighting Vehicles, he was eager to take on responsibility in the field. However, despite his eagerness, he was not considered suited for a Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) position.

John’s journey with the Canadian Army took him first through Canada from 1939 to 1941, then across to the United Kingdom, where he served from October 1941 until October 1943. In late 1943, he was deployed to the Italian front, arriving on October 27, as Allied forces pushed through Italy in a series of grueling campaigns. His service in Italy was marked by resilience and courage, though not without personal sacrifice. 
Sometime before March 1944, John was wounded in action. He spent nearly three weeks recovering at the Canadian General Hospital before returning to duty, exemplifying the strength and resolve characteristic of so many in his regiment.

At 5 feet 5 inches and weighing 142 pounds, with striking blue eyes, John Mackay had a quiet yet determined presence. Colleagues and superiors alike found him cooperative and hard-working. Beyond his military role, he engaged in various sports and activities, enjoying hunting, skating, and swimming in his youth. He also had a talent for team sports, playing as a center in hockey and a forward in soccer, showcasing his skill and teamwork on the ice and field alike.

Sadly, John’s life and dreams of post-war peace would not come to fruition. On December 20, 1944, during his service in Italy, Corporal Mackay was killed in action at just 34 years old. 
He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, a final resting place for many who fought in the Italian Campaign. His grave is marked in Plot IV, Row C, Grave 6—a lasting tribute to a man who served with honor, selflessness, and an enduring hope for a brighter future.

Though he would not see his ambition of becoming an electrician realized, Corporal John Angus Mackay’s legacy remains as a symbol of dedication and sacrifice. His story speaks to the courage and humanity of those who served, leaving behind families, friends, and dreams to answer the call of duty.
