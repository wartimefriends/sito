John James Fraser was born on February 29, 1920, in Stellarton, Nova Scotia, to Andrew and Mrs. Andrew Fraser. He was the eldest of seven children, with three brothers—Duncan, Donald, and Billy—and three sisters—Bridget, June, and Casimir. His parents were Scottish immigrants, and John’s childhood was marked by a normal and stable home life.

John completed grade nine and part of grade ten before leaving school to support himself. 
On July 6, 1940, he married Elizabeth Jessie in St. Catharines, Ontario. The couple welcomed their daughter, Frances Ann, on June 20, 1941, and John worked hard to provide for his young family. Employed as a milk salesman and delivery driver for Silverwoods Dairy Ltd., John earned $35 a week, and his employers promised him a position after the war.

Standing 5’11” tall and weighing 175 pounds, John was a sturdy young man with blue eyes, red hair, and a medium complexion. Known for his neat appearance and strong military bearing, he was cooperative and determined to improve his life through his own efforts. His hobbies included collecting phonograph records, and he was an avid athlete who played football, hockey (as a center), and baseball and softball (as a catcher).

Driven by patriotism, John delayed enlisting until he had settled his financial obligations following his marriage. On November 12, 1942, he joined the Canadian Army in Toronto, Ontario. Initially assigned to the #2 District Depot, he later transferred to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. He was promoted to sergeant on June 3, 1943, and proved to be a capable leader, eager to improve his skills and contribute meaningfully to the war effort.

John underwent training in Canada before being deployed to the United Kingdom on June 11, 1943. After more than a year in Britain, he joined the Italian Campaign on July 17, 1944, where his regiment played a vital role in the Allied push to liberate Italy. Known for his cooperative nature and willingness to take on challenges, John embodied the qualities of a committed soldier, striving to give his best at every opportunity.

On December 20, 1944, during operations near the Fosso Munio in northern Italy, John was killed in action. He was just 24 years old.

Sergeant John James Fraser was laid to rest in the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, where his grave stands as a solemn tribute to his service and sacrifice. 
His journey—from a young family man in St. Catharines to a sergeant on the front lines of Italy—reflects the courage and dedication of his generation.

John’s legacy endures in the hearts of his family and the history of those who fought for freedom and peace. 
His sacrifice is a poignant reminder of the cost of war and the enduring impact of his commitment to a better future for his family and country.
