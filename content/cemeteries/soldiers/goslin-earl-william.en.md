Private Earl William Goslin’s life reflects a journey of resilience, determination, and ultimate sacrifice. 
Born on January 20, 1913, in Edmonton, Alberta, Earl was the eldest of five siblings in a rural family. His parents, Arthur William and Elizabeth Goslin, raised him alongside his brother George and three sisters: Kathleen, Mrs. William Givilliams, and Mrs. Albert Schultz. Growing up in North Cooking Lake, Alberta, Earl developed a strong work ethic, taking on responsibilities early in life to support his family.

Earl attended a rural elementary school, completing grade six. While he did not enjoy school, he got along well with his teachers and peers. His childhood hobbies included collecting rifles and ammunition, showcasing an early interest in mechanical and practical skills.

As a young adult, Earl gained extensive experience in labor-intensive trades. He worked for four years as a farm laborer, operating tractors and threshing machines. Later, he drove trucks and caterpillar tractors for the Department of Mines for nearly a decade, gaining valuable skills that would later serve him in the military. At the time of his enlistment, Earl was employed as a machine operator for Chief Engineers, a construction company based in Red Pass Junction.

Despite a history of instability in his youth, including 28 days in detention for assault and 13 months in Portage for juvenile offenses, Earl grew into a dependable and reliable individual. His commanding officers noted his improved stability, good attitude, and responsibility as he matured. 
Standing 5’8” tall and weighing 142 pounds, Earl had a dark complexion, black hair, blue eyes, and wore glasses. 
Despite occasional foot trouble and a history of rheumatism, he was considered physically fit and well-suited for military service.

On September 19, 1942, Earl enlisted in the Canadian Army in Edmonton, Alberta. Assigned to the Westminster Regiment (Motorized) in July 1943, his experience with heavy machinery made him an asset as a truck operator. After completing his training in Canada, Earl was deployed to the United Kingdom in May 1943, preparing for the demands of war. 
By November 1943, he joined the Italian Campaign, a grueling effort to liberate Italy from Axis control.

The Italian Campaign was characterized by harsh conditions and fierce battles. Earl’s regiment, part of the 5th Canadian Armoured Division, played a crucial role in advancing through the Italian countryside. 
On December 16, 1944, Earl’s unit participated in a critical operation to secure the Fosso Munio. The plan involved a precise artillery barrage and the deployment of Wasp flame-throwing carriers. However, a miscommunication caused the Wasps to move in early, throwing the operation into chaos.

Despite the confusion, Earl’s platoon charged forward under Lt. Hoult’s leadership, using the demoralizing effect of the flamethrowers to overwhelm the enemy. They secured the objective just minutes before the scheduled artillery barrage, which was canceled after frantic wireless communication. The platoon dug in and repelled a counterattack by enemy forces later that night, enduring heavy shelling and intense combat.

Tragically, Private Earl William Goslin was killed during this operation, along with Corporal Gosselin and Private J.D. Macaulay. His loss was deeply felt by his comrades and his family back home. 
Earl left behind a common-law wife, Laura May, and their daughter, Patricia Helen Elizabeth, born on March 4, 1942. Laura May requested all of Earl’s personal belongings, including letters and papers, as cherished reminders of his life and sacrifice.

Private Earl William Goslin was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot V, Row A, Grave 10. His grave serves as a solemn tribute to his courage and dedication, a reminder of the sacrifices made by so many in the fight for freedom.

Earl’s journey from rural Alberta to the battlefields of Italy is a testament to his resilience and commitment. His ultimate sacrifice reflects the bravery and determination of those who served during one of the most challenging periods in history. 
Private Earl William Goslin’s legacy endures in the hearts of his family, comrades, and the generations who live in the peace he helped secure.
