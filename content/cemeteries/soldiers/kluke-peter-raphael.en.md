Peter Ralph KLUKE born on October 21, 1923, in Otter Lake, Quebec, was raised in a close-knit family in rural Quebec, a place that shaped his early years. 
He attended a local school from age seven until thirteen, leaving formal education early to help his family make a living. His schooling was marked by language barriers and teacher turnover, making progression challenging. Although his English skills improved with time, French remained a struggle throughout his life.

Peter’s occupational background reflected the hard-working spirit of his family. He worked for Gillis Brothers Ltd. in a lumber camp, spending summers in sawmills and winters cutting firewood. He also worked as a taxi driver briefly, but his ambition extended beyond these early jobs, as he aspired to become a carpenter. The experience he gained in lumber camps and manual labor would later contribute to his military service.

He enlisted on September 17, 1943, in Montreal, motivated by a strong sense of duty and a desire to join three of his brothers already serving in the Canadian Army overseas. His early service began at the 4 DD in Montreal, followed by stints at training centers in North Bay, Ontario, and Windsor, Nova Scotia. After basic training, he traveled to the United Kingdom in June 1944 and shortly after was sent to Italy to join the front lines.

Peter stood at just under 5’6” and weighed around 115 pounds, with blue eyes and blonde hair. Although his initial assessment noted a few minor health issues, including asthma and hay fever, he was deemed fit for overseas service. His instructors described him as quiet, attentive, and hard-working. Despite his limited formal education, he completed his basic and advanced infantry training, qualifying in areas like rifle and light machine gun (LMG) instruction, though he showed varying proficiency across these skills.

During his training, Peter fired 53 out of 60 on small arms and 60 out of 100 on ball ammunition. When using the Bren LMG for the first time, he scored 21 out of 40, showing potential with the weapon. His instructors recommended additional coaching, particularly in map reading and gas training, areas where he struggled.

As a Polish-Canadian, Peter’s background posed unique challenges in communication, especially since he lacked fluency in French and would not have been suited for training centers with solely French instruction. He primarily spoke English and Polish, which, in combination with his limited education, influenced his training and placement.

By May 1944, Peter had completed eight weeks of advanced training and adapted well to military life. His commanders found him eager, disciplined, and well-mannered. Although he applied to take a Dispatch Rider course in Canada, space limitations prevented him from pursuing it.

Private Kluke’s journey ended tragically on December 13, 1944, when he was killed in action in Italy. He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, where his grave in Plot II, Row C, Grave 3 honors his memory.
