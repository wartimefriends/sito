title = "Private Aage LARSEN, a soldier with the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards in the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, was a man of quiet determination and a deep-rooted sense of duty. Born on December 17, 1905, in Viskinge, Sjælland, Denmark, Aage grew up in a large family as the fifth of seven children. Although he enjoyed his school years, he left his education early to help support his family financially."

In 1926, at the age of 20, Aage emigrated to Canada in search of new opportunities. By 1935, he was a naturalized Canadian citizen, having embraced his new homeland with dedication and sincerity.

Aage spent his early years in Canada working primarily in farming during the summers and logging in the winter months. These roles allowed him to establish a strong work ethic and a connection to the land, and he continued to engage in these seasonal occupations for nearly 15 years. His practical skills grew over time, and he held various jobs in production, including at the Reliable Toy Company and Massey Harris Company. By the time of his enlistment, he was employed as a tire builder at Gutta Percha & Rubber Company in Toronto. 
Although reserved and leading a quiet life in Canada, Aage was content and had a desire to serve his adopted country with distinction.

On September 1, 1943, at the age of 37, Aage enlisted in the Canadian Army in Toronto. Driven by a sincere commitment to serve, he joined the Royal Canadian Artillery, training as a field gunner. His previous military experience with the 32nd Regiment in Toronto and his natural strength made him a reliable and competent recruit. Aage’s physical characteristics—standing 5 feet 7 ¼ inches, with fair hair and blue eyes—reflected his Danish roots, and while he spoke English well, he retained a slight accent. Though he had no family in Canada, he found companionship in social and recreational activities and approached military service with a calm and resolute manner.

Following his training in Canada, Aage was deployed to the United Kingdom in April 1944 and then to Italy in May, where he joined the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards. His unit played a key role in the Italian Campaign, which demanded perseverance and grit from all who served. Aage was well-prepared for the physical demands of service and took on his duties with characteristic steadiness, remaining determined even under the hardships of war.

Aage’s aspirations reflected his love for the land and his hope for a peaceful future. He looked forward to returning to farming and his work as a tire builder after the war, seeing his time in the military as a duty to his new home. Unfortunately, that future was never realized. 
On December 15, 1944, just two days shy of his 39th birthday, Aage was killed in action in Italy. His loss was deeply felt, and a memorial bar was sent to his father, Jens P. Larsen, back in Denmark—a testament to the enduring bond between Aage and his family, despite the distance and years apart.

Today, Private Aage Larsen rests in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot VI, Row A, Grave 6, his final resting place among the fallen who, like him, served with honor and sacrifice. 
Aage’s story is one of dedication to a country he came to love and a commitment to a cause he deemed worthy of his life. His quiet strength and loyalty remain a lasting tribute to the courage of those who chose to serve and sacrifice far from home.
