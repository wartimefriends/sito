Harold Alfred Griffin’s story is one of dedication, resilience, and quiet service, reflecting the journey of a young man who answered the call to duty during the Second World War. 
Born on June 18, 1923, in Glen Morris, Ontario, Harold was one of nine children in a farming family. Raised by his parents, Alfred and Minnie Griffin, alongside his brothers William, Bruce, Gordon, and Milton, and sisters Lula, Verna, Eleanor, and Arthur Fletcher, Harold grew up with strong family values and a solid work ethic.

Harold left school at the age of 16 after completing Grade VIII to work full-time on the family farm. His days were filled with the responsibilities of farm life, from tending to crops and livestock to handling machinery like tractors and trucks, performing minor repairs, and contributing to the household’s livelihood. This upbringing molded Harold into a strong, dependable young man, described as likable, well-mannered, and hard-working.

On June 28, 1943, at the age of 20, Harold enlisted in the Canadian Army in Toronto, Ontario. Standing 5’5½” tall and weighing 127 pounds, he was noted for his rugged build and capacity for endurance. His records described him as a cooperative individual with a pleasant disposition and better-than-average stability, characteristics that made him well-suited for military life.

Harold began his military journey with basic training at #20 Basic Training Centre in Brantford, Ontario, where he performed admirably. By November 1943, he had completed full infantry training at A-10 Canadian Infantry Training Centre, earning recognition for his clean conduct record and willingness to learn. Harold was recommended for an automotive trade course, where he trained as a “Driver I/C” (in charge) and qualified as a Class 3 Driver. His adaptability and reliability made him an excellent candidate for operational duties.

In June 1944, Harold was deployed overseas, beginning his service in the United Kingdom before being sent to Italy the following month. 
As a member of the Perth Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Harold joined the grueling Italian Campaign. This campaign was marked by relentless combat and challenging conditions as Allied forces advanced through Italy, facing fierce German resistance.

Tragically, Harold’s service was cut short on December 20, 1944, during operations along via Chiara at Villa Prati, Bagnacavallo. 
He was killed in action at just 21 years old, leaving behind his loving family and a legacy of courage and selflessness.

Private Harold Alfred Griffin was laid to rest at Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot IV, Row A, Grave 8. His grave is a solemn tribute to his sacrifice and a reminder of the countless lives given in the fight for freedom.

Harold Griffin’s story is one of quiet heroism and dedication, from his humble beginnings on a farm in Glen Morris to the battlefields of Italy. His willingness to serve, his hard work, and his commitment to his comrades exemplify the spirit of his generation. 
Though his life was tragically brief, the memory of Private Harold Alfred Griffin lives on, honoring his service and sacrifice for his country.
