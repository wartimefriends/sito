Gerald Favreau was born on August 12, 1919, in Ottawa, Ontario, to Elzear and Valeda Favreau. Growing up in a large family, Gerald was the fourth of eight children. 
Tragically, his siblings endured significant losses, with three sisters—Lionel, Liliane, and Fleurette—passing away young and his sister Jeannette dying shortly after Gerald’s death in January 1945. Despite these hardships, Gerald’s childhood home was described as harmonious, and he shared a close bond with his surviving brothers: Lucien, Roland, Ronald, and Philippe.

Gerald completed Grade 8 and was fluent in both French and English, though he spoke very little English before his enlistment. His early work history was diverse, reflecting his willingness to take on various roles. He worked as a grocery clerk at the Byward Market, a truck driver for the National Dairy Company, and a bottler at O’Keefe Beverages in Ottawa. His weekly earnings ranged from $12 to $17.50. Gerald’s hobbies included working with engines and mechanics, swimming, bicycling, and playing team sports like hockey and softball.

At 5’6” tall and weighing 158 pounds, Gerald had a ruddy complexion, brown hair, and blue eyes. He was noted for his neat appearance, healthy physique, cooperative manner, and pleasant disposition. 
Seeking adventure and opportunities to improve himself, Gerald enlisted in the Canadian Army on February 19, 1941, in Ottawa, joining the 4th Reconnaissance Battalion of the Princess Louise Dragoon Guards. His enlistment was driven by a desire to better himself and his interest in receiving mechanics training or serving as a driver.

Gerald trained in Canada until June 1941, when he was deployed to the United Kingdom. He served there for over two years before joining the Italian Campaign in August 1943. During his service, Gerald proved proficient as a Bren gunner and performed reasonably well as a cook. However, he occasionally voiced frustrations about conflicting orders from N.C.O.s, highlighting his eagerness for structured teamwork and leadership.

As part of the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, Gerald participated in critical reconnaissance missions during the Italian Campaign, a grueling theater of war marked by challenging terrain, harsh conditions, and fierce resistance from German forces. His duties required courage and adaptability as his unit supported the Allied push to liberate Italy.

On December 19, 1944, Gerald was killed in action during operations near the Fosso Munio in northern Italy. His sacrifice came as his regiment faced heavy shelling and counterattacks, highlighting the relentless dangers of the campaign. 
Gerald was just 25 years old.

Private Gerald Favreau was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where his grave stands as a testament to his service and sacrifice. Though his family struggled to locate photographs or detailed records of his life, Gerald’s story reflects the quiet heroism and dedication of soldiers who overcame personal challenges to serve their country.

From his modest beginnings in Ottawa to his ultimate sacrifice on the Italian front, Gerald’s life is a poignant reminder of the courage and commitment of his generation. 
His memory endures as part of the legacy of those who gave their lives in the fight for freedom and peace.
