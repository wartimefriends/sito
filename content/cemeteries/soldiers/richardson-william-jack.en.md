title = "Private William Jack RICHARDSON was born on February 17, 1921, in St. Marys, Ontario, to John Alfred and Minnie Alice Richardson. As the eldest of three siblings, he grew up with a strong sense of family and responsibility, sharing his early years with his brother, Robert Percival, and two sisters, Irene Lorrain and Evelyn Audrey. Known for his fair complexion, blue eyes, and brown hair, William stood 5 feet 7 1/2 inches tall and weighed a solid 165 pounds, embodying the quiet strength and resilience typical of his generation."

William’s early life was grounded in simplicity and hard work. He attended school until the age of 14, completing grade 10 before deciding to leave and enter the workforce to help support his family. His employment history reflected his work ethic and adaptability: he delivered milk for H. Sparling Dairy in St. Marys from 1937 to 1940, and later worked as a laborer at Adams Wagon Works in Brantford, earning a respectable $50 a week. A young man of action, he enjoyed outdoor activities such as hunting and fishing, and on the hockey rink, he played forward, channeling his energy into the sport he loved.

On June 20, 1940, at the age of 19, William enlisted in the Canadian Army in Stratford, Ontario. Although he didn’t specify his reasons for enlisting, his early choice to join the Perth Regiment, a unit with a rich history in the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, suggested a sense of duty and an eagerness to serve. He quickly adapted to military life, beginning his service in Canada, where he trained with the Perth Regiment (Machine Gun) CASF Depot. By October 6, 1941, he was sent to the United Kingdom, where he remained for nearly two years, preparing for the grueling battles to come.

In October 1943, William was deployed to Italy, joining his regiment in one of the most intense theaters of World War II. The Italian Campaign was known for its challenging conditions, requiring endurance, strength, and resilience as Allied forces fought through rugged terrain to push back the Axis powers. William’s dedication to his duty was unwavering, and his military service became a defining part of his life. He expressed a desire to remain in the army, showing that he had found a purpose and direction within the ranks.

Tragically, on December 20, 1944, Private William Jack Richardson was killed in action along via Chiara at Villa Prati, Bagnacavallo. 
He was 23 years old. His final resting place is at Villanova War Cemetery in Plot IV, Row C, Grave 4, where he lies among fellow soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice. William’s story is one of a young man who left behind the familiar comforts of small-town life for the uncertainties and dangers of war. His legacy endures as a testament to courage, loyalty, and the willingness to serve, qualities that are remembered with honor by his family, his community, and his country.
