Private Paul Salmon, a dedicated soldier of the Royal Montreal Regiment, is remembered for his courage and ultimate sacrifice.

Born on January 24, 1918, in Montreal, Quebec, Paul was a young man of medium build, standing 5 feet 6.5 inches tall, with grey eyes and brown hair. 
He was raised in a close-knit Catholic family as the third of four children, with parents Alfred and Marie, and siblings Marcel, Laurette, and Jeanette.

Growing up, Paul completed eight years of public school before finding work as a salesman for Cone Ltd., a company specializing in ice cream cones, where he worked for five years. 
When he was 24 years old, he chose to enlist, signing up on June 5, 1942, in South Montreal. It was a time of upheaval and responsibility, but Paul felt a deep sense of duty and stepped forward to serve his country during the turbulent days of World War II.

Once enlisted, Paul was transferred first to the 3rd Rivers Regiment on August 11, 1942, and subsequently to the Canadian Infantry Corps (CIC) on August 31, 1943. 
He took up his post with C Company of the Royal Montreal Regiment, part of the Irish Regiment of Canada, and deployed to the United Kingdom on December 13, 1942. 
By October of 1943, he had reached Italy, where he would remain until the final days of his service. Known to be of average intelligence, Paul was a good-natured and sociable young man who enjoyed dancing, billiards, and snowmobiling. He aspired to become a signaler and, according to his superiors, had potential for specialized roles, possibly even as a machine gunner if trained.

Paul’s journey through the war was a path of courage and perseverance. From his early service in Canada, through training and deployments in the UK, and finally to the Italian front, he proved himself a reliable and steadfast soldier. Tragically, on January 2, 1945, while his regiment was engaged in a critical mission to establish a bridgehead at the Fossa Lamone in San Alberto, Italy, 
Paul was killed during a shell attack.

Private Paul Salmon was laid to rest at the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, where he lies in Plot II, Row B, Grave 3. 
His story is one of dedication to duty and sacrifice. Though he never returned home to Montreal, his memory endures in the hearts of his family and fellow soldiers who carry forward the legacy of his service.
