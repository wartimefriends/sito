Howard Francis LAUZON of the 9th Armored Regiment, British Columbia Dragoons, Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, was a young man whose life was defined by hard work, family dedication, and, ultimately, sacrifice.
 
Born on October 8, 1921, in Cornwall, Ontario, Howard was the fourth of eight children in a close-knit family. His father, Napoleon, and mother, Mary Louise, raised him alongside his five brothers—Harole Napoleon, Charles Henry, John Earl, William Douglas, and Robert Wesley—and two sisters, Mary Helen and Viola Marguerite. Growing up, Howard embraced his roots, a mix of British and French Canadian heritage, and was instilled with a sense of duty that would later guide his actions.

Howard’s early years were marked by a strong work ethic. He left school at age 14, after completing Grade 8, and worked a series of jobs to support his family and gain experience. Over five years, he took on roles ranging from section hand on the railroad to general labor in a furniture factory and farm work. 
His main employment before enlisting was with S. McDougall, where he gained three years of practical experience in farming, a skill that gave him familiarity with machinery and outdoor labor. Despite his limited formal education, Howard had a calm and steady demeanor and was described as easygoing and dependable.

On August 19, 1941, at the age of 19, Howard enlisted in Ottawa, Ontario, joining the Canadian Armoured Corps (C.A.C.) in the 9th Armored Regiment, known as the British Columbia Dragoons. With the onset of World War II, Howard felt a duty to serve his country, a decision that was fully supported by his wife, Dorothy Jean. The couple had one daughter, Dorothy Geraldine Elizabeth, who remained with her mother during Howard’s time overseas. Dorothy’s health was good, and she held a supportive attitude toward his service, giving Howard peace of mind as he prepared to fulfill his commitment to his country.

Howard’s military service took him from Canada to the United Kingdom, where he served from April 1942 to November 1943. In the U.K., he completed his training as a driver and reconnaissance gunner, roles that suited his steady nature and practical skills. Although not particularly mechanically inclined by military standards, he demonstrated dedication, completing qualifications as a Driver Mechanic and achieving certification as a Q Driver I.C. III. His comrades noted him as a slow but thoughtful thinker, someone whose commitment and attention to detail made him a steady presence in the demanding conditions of wartime.

In November 1943, Howard was deployed to Italy as part of the Italian Campaign, where he faced the harsh and unrelenting conditions that defined the Allied advance. His role as a reconnaissance gunner and driver required him to navigate difficult terrain under fire, a job that demanded resilience and courage. Despite recurrent earaches and the discomfort of corns on his toes, Howard showed no complaints, performing his duties with quiet resolve.

Away from the front lines, Howard was a man of simple pleasures. He enjoyed fishing, hockey, and lacrosse, often playing center position in local games. His easygoing disposition extended to his personal interests, and he found comfort in familiar activities, maintaining a connection to his roots even in the midst of war. Although he harbored an ambition to pursue mechanics, his primary focus remained on his duty and service.

Tragically, Howard’s life was cut short on December 13, 1944, during his service in Italy. 
At just 23 years old, he made the ultimate sacrifice, leaving behind his wife, young daughter, and family in Cornwall who would forever remember him as a devoted husband, father, and soldier. 
Howard is buried in Villanova War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot VII, Row A, Grave 3, where he rests alongside many others who gave their lives in pursuit of peace.

Howard Francis Lauzon’s story is one of dedication, resilience, and quiet heroism. Despite the challenges he faced, he answered the call to serve his country and gave everything in doing so. 
His memory endures as a symbol of the sacrifices made by countless young men who, like Howard, chose duty and honor above all else.
