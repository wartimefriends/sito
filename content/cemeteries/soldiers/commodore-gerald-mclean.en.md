Private Gerald McLean Commodore was born on August 2, 1921, in Smiths Falls, Ontario, into a loving and hardworking family. The second of five children, Gerald grew up with three brothers—Donald, Gordon, and William—and a sister, Mary, who served with the Canadian Women’s Army Corps (CWAC) in Montreal. Raised by his parents, William Charles and Lena, Gerald’s childhood was described as happy and stable.

Gerald completed Grade 5 but left school early, uninterested in academics and eager to enter the workforce. His early jobs reflected his strong work ethic and mechanical aptitude, including work as a truck driver for T. Easton Co. Ltd. in Hamilton, Ontario, from 1939 to 1942, and a brief stint as a driver for a glass company. 
His hobbies included motorcycles, airplane motors, bowling, swimming, and basketball, showcasing his enthusiasm for mechanics and physical activity.

At 5’7” tall and weighing 140 pounds, Gerald was described as wiry, cheerful, and polite, with blue eyes and a neat appearance. 
Mechanically inclined, he was skilled as a driver-mechanic and enjoyed working with machinery. His practical experience made him a valuable addition to the military when he enlisted on May 29, 1942, in Hamilton, Ontario.

Gerald’s enlistment was motivated by a genuine desire to serve. Initially joining the 2nd/10th Dragoons, a reserve unit, he transitioned to active duty and underwent training in Canada before being deployed overseas in September 1943. After several months in the United Kingdom, Gerald joined the Italian Campaign in March 1944, one of the most grueling theaters of the Second World War.

By July 1944, Gerald was assigned to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (PLDG), a regiment tasked with reconnaissance and critical combat support. His role as a driver-mechanic in the PLDG required resilience, mechanical skill, and courage, particularly in the unforgiving conditions of the Italian front.

Gerald balanced his military responsibilities with his devotion to his family. 
Married to Anna May Gladys, he was the father of two young sons, Gerald LeRoy and Randolph Carl. Despite the challenges of war, he remained a loving husband and father, cherishing his family even from afar.

Tragically, on December 13, 1944, during intense combat near Villanova, Italy, Gerald was killed in action. He was just 23 years old.

Private Gerald McLean Commodore was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot I, Row B, Grave 6. His grave serves as a solemn tribute to his service and sacrifice.

Gerald’s story is one of determination, hard work, and devotion. From his early days as a truck driver in Hamilton to the battlefields of Italy, he exemplified the qualities of resilience and commitment. 
Though his life was tragically brief, Gerald’s sacrifice embodies the courage and dedication of his generation.

His memory lives on in the hearts of his family, his community, and the history of the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards. 
Gerald McLean Commodore’s legacy reminds us of the profound cost of war and the enduring impact of those who gave their all for freedom.
