Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps

Robert Brooks was born on November 15, 1903, in St. Charles, Manitoba. 
However, his life story reveals a complex and mysterious background, with records indicating he may have originally been named Engelhard Bruegger, born in Churwalden, Switzerland. Raised by his mother, who remained in Switzerland, Robert was the eldest of three children, with two sisters. His father passed away when he was young.

Robert immigrated to Canada in his early 20s, embracing a life of hard work and community. He was fluent in both French and English and had completed Grade 9. He began his career as a butcher for Gordon Ironsides in Winnipeg, earning $22 per week, before transitioning to work as a coal and hard rock miner at the M&S Coal Mine in Taylorton, Saskatchewan. 
By the time of his enlistment, Robert was employed as a greenskeeper at a golf course, demonstrating his versatility and dedication.

In 1925, Robert married Rita, and together they built a life in St. Charles, Manitoba. They had three children—Henry N.E. (or Joseph Norman, as recorded in some documents), Norma Anne, and William Dennis. Despite the challenges of supporting a family during the Great Depression, Robert’s determination and work ethic never wavered. 
His dark brown hair, hazel eyes, and dark complexion reflected his rugged life of labor, and he was described as active, fairly aggressive, and a capable tradesman.

On June 8, 1940, Robert enlisted in Winnipeg, driven by a sense of duty to his adopted country. Initially attached to District Depot #10, he began his training in Canada before being deployed to the United Kingdom in December 1940. 
During his time in the UK, Robert expressed a desire to join the Royal Canadian Engineers’ Tunnelling Corps, hoping to leverage his extensive mining experience for military purposes.

In October 1943, Robert joined the Italian Campaign, where he served with distinction. The campaign was one of the most grueling theaters of the Second World War, demanding exceptional resilience and courage from all who served. On October 26, 1944, he was reassigned to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, which was engaged in intense combat in the effort to liberate Italy.

Tragically, on December 13, 1944, Robert was killed in action at the Fosso Vecchio, between Villanova and Villa Prati. He was 41 years old. 
His death left behind a grieving widow and three children, as well as unresolved questions about his past. Post-war inquiries by individuals in England claiming to be family complicated his already intricate story. Documentation from Switzerland also surfaced, identifying him as a Swiss citizen named Engelhard Bruegger. These conflicting accounts have left his true origins shrouded in mystery.

Private Robert Brooks was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot VI, Row B, Grave 2. His grave serves as a poignant reminder of his service and sacrifice.

Robert’s story is one of dedication, resilience, and enigma. From his early days in Switzerland to his life as a miner and soldier in Canada, he exemplified the courage and determination of his generation. 
His ultimate sacrifice for his adopted country stands as a testament to the many who gave their lives for freedom, even as their full stories remain untold.
