+++

Floyd's father, Arthur was a man of Military history. As a Canadian and at the young age of 18 he joined the American Army during the Spanish American War 1898. Arthur served in Company "" Regiment of Michigan, U.S.A. and served in Cuba 1898 and 1899. 
He returned to Sarnia to open his own retail paint and wallpaper business. In
1914 with world peace threatened, Arthur and his five brothers joined the army. He served as a Captain with the Royal Canadian Regiment, 34" Battalion until December, 1917. He was then declared medically unfit for service. He had been tossed by the concussion of a shell, hit with shrapnel and suffered in a gas attack. Some of his engagements included Ypre, Hill 60, Sanctuary Wood, Hell Fire and Sharparell Corners, in France. He returned to civilian life and once able he eventually returned to his trade and opened his business. Arthur died in May 1941 of complications from the War.
After Floyd’s father Arthur passing, his mother Letitia was challenged to care for her family, in particular, her youngest son. She took in borders to assist her. Around this time her two sons, Fred and Floyd joined the Canadian Army. Fred was the elder brother to Floyd who was slightly less than two years younger. These two young men were very close to each other as brothers and prepared to set off for World War lI.
Many young men from Sarnia, Ontario, Canada were enlisted, served and paid the ultimate sacrifice with their lives. The attached picture shows a number of young "Sarnia boys" who left Sarnia for training with an anti-aircraft battery in Vancouver, Canada's Pacific west coast, prior to being sent overseas. Kindly note the logo on their Football Jerseys. Many of these soldiers in this photo were also very good athletes. These young men were exceptional people and for those fortunate enough to return to Sarnia, shared a love for their City and for the relatives of those who fought. They contributed to their Community and although most have passed on, memories of them are held strong and close to the heart of the citizens of Sarnia.

Fred and Floyd Williams set off for England and from there were sent to Southern Italy.
Attached picture of Floyd in uniform was taken "near an Abbey in England on a beautiful day" as he stated in a letter back to his Mother. Floyd was subsequently sent to northern Italy where fighting was taking place. Fred was detained a few days before being sent north as well.
Days passed and Fred eventually learned that his younger brother had been killed in action. 
Word reached back to Floyd's Mother and his young wife and all dreams were shattered.
Fred brought back the rest of the story as to what happened. Apparently, they were engaged in house to house combat, trying to dislodge the Nazi soldiers in various houses. The large Canadian guns were firing over the heads of the troops to soften the enemy. Many of the men were very close to the line of fire and with all of the gun battle and heavy artillery many were killed.

It is also told that many Canadian soldiers were killed by some of their own heavy artillery shells, a tragedy.
Kindly refer to attached excerpt of a letter from Private W.E. Leroy to Mrs. Williams which tells of Floyd's will and character. This excerpt was taken from a newspaper article that appeared in the Sarnia Observer newspaper and as recorded in the Williams family history written by Floyd's older brother, Reverend Earl Williams now deceased.
Floyd George Williams was a store clerk prior to joining the Army. He married Ms. Norine Demery of Sarnia, April 23, 1943. 
Killed in action at age 22, our Family was always aware that Floyd is buried in a military cemetery. There were conflicting Family records which stated "buried in military cemetery #11 near the Lamorie River at Ravenna, Italy." Another states "somewhere near the Lomeny River." It came with great surprise and elation to the nephews of Floyd March, 23, 2009 when a form letter requesting information on Private Floyd Williams arrived at the residence of Lee Williams in Sarnia. Donna Maxwell of Calgary, Alberta, Canada was attempting to find information on soldiers for a book residents of the Town of Villanova want to publish regarding all 206 soldiers buried in Villanova. Donna finally solved the unknown location as to where Floyd is buried. We thank her and the people of Villanova.

Fred and Floyd were brothers to four other siblings who all contributed to the war effort in a positive way. However, elder siblings were considered too old to serve and the youngest was only eleven years of age when War broke.
The Williams Family is a large family with deep local roots. Most of the younger generations have remained in the Sarnia region. Our ancestors came from rather humble beginnings in Wales and were hard working people and some through history were strong leaders. Fred and Floyd both exemplified these qualities and forever will be held dear to our hearts.

Late Pte. F. Williams saved Comrade

Shortly before he was killed in Italy a few months ago, Private Floyd G. Williams had risked his Iife to rescue one of his wounded comrades in a Canadian Army unit. It has been revealed in a Ietter from Pte. W. E. LeRoy to Mrs. Williams "The two soldiers became close friends during two months together with a famous Canadian regiment fighting in Italy. FinaIly they ran into a prolonged action which resulted in Pte. LeRoy being seriously wounded and Pte. Williams being killed. Their section of men was moving from a house under German shell and mortar fire to another. house 175 yards away
when Pte. LeRoy was wounded in the stomach and arm. “I didn't pass out, but couldn't get up, “ Pte. LeRoy's Ietter said, Floyd and the others were okay as they were still going for the house. I think I had just about given up all hope of getting anywhere when I saw Floyd turn his head and look back. I guess he, realized I was hit because the next second he was coming across the open field. “ I tried, to holler to him to get the hell into the house, but my voice was no more than a whisper. Even if I could have yelled it, I doubt if he' d have heard me; the mortars and shells exploding all around made too much noise. When he reached me, I told him to scram, but it was no use talking. He got me
on my feet and by half-carrying me we got back accross the fi eld to the house. I' Il never know how, but we did. I was laid on a mattress and Floyd helped to put on the shell dressings. That was the last I saw of Floyd, as they moved on and I was taken out to the hospital. I don’t t think I need tell you how I felt when they told me Floyd didn’t come back. And I’II never forget how he looked coming back across that field to get me . People like him never reaIly die, Mrs. Williams. Perhaps they live onIy in the memory of those who knew them, but they live.
