<br>


Charles Robert Flewelling, affectionately known to those close to him as Bob, was born on May 25, 1924, in West Garafraxa Township, Wellington County, Ontario, into a family deeply rooted in the rural life of Canada. The son of Enos Phillip Flewelling and Cora (Howes), Charles was the third of four children, with two sisters, Isabel (McKenzie) and Anna, and a brother, Harold. 
He grew up on the family farm, where he developed a strong work ethic and an appreciation for the simple, yet demanding, rural life.

Standing at 5’9” and weighing 149 pounds, Charles had a striking presence, with his dark complexion, hazel eyes, and dark brown hair. Raised in the faith of the United Church, he was known for his active participation in the Young People’s Society and was a regular churchgoer. When not working on the farm, he enjoyed sports, movies, and social activities, though he admitted to not reading much. A heavy smoker and moderate drinker, he was a typical young man of his era, drawn to camaraderie and community.

Charles’ education concluded with high school entrance, after which he dedicated himself to farming, a calling that would later reflect his reliability and dedication. 
But as the shadow of World War II loomed, Charles, like many young men of his generation, felt the call to serve. When asked why he enlisted, his simple yet poignant response was, “All the rest are joining up.”

On April 15, 1942, at the age of 17, Charles enlisted in London, Ontario, joining the Number I District Depot of the Royal Canadian Artillery (RCA). Over time, his mechanical aptitude and interest in all things mechanical were noted by his superiors. Initially stationed in Canada, Charles completed training and was later posted to the United Kingdom on October 24, 1943, before being sent to the active theater in Italy on November 4, 1944.

On November 18, 1944, Charles was officially taken on strength by the Irish Regiment of Canada, a moment that marked his transition to the frontlines of one of the war’s most grueling campaigns. Serving in Italy during the closing stages of the Italian Campaign, he was thrust into the thick of the fighting. His service earned him the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal (CVSM) on August 24, 1944, a recognition of his dedication and sacrifice.

Tragically, Charles’ life was cut short on December 20, 1944, during an artillery barrage near the Senio River, west of the Fosso Munio, in one of the many fierce battles of the Italian Campaign. At just 20 years old, he made the ultimate sacrifice, leaving behind a grieving family and a community forever changed by his loss.

Charles was laid to rest with honor at the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, a testament to his bravery and the countless sacrifices made by Canadian soldiers during the war. 
His grave can be found in Plot III, Row A, Grave 3, a solemn reminder of a young life given in service to his country.

Though his time was brief, Charles Robert Flewelling’s dedication, courage, and spirit continue to resonate as a powerful reminder of the sacrifices made by the greatest generation. 
His legacy lives on in the fields of Wellington County and in the hearts of those who cherish his memory.
