#### Lanark and Renfrew Regiment, R.C.I.C.
<br>


Private John Sinclair, a member of the Lanark and Renfrew Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps (R.C.I.C.), served his country with bravery until his life was tragically cut short in action on January 6, 1945, at age 38. He is remembered at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in plot I-A-3.

John was born on February 23, 1906, in the scenic region of Lachawe, Argyllshire, Scotland. His early life was marked by hardship; he was the fourth of five children in a family deeply affected by the early loss of his mother when he was just nine years old. John’s father, also named John, was a farmer, while his older siblings and extended family members continued to shape his life even after his move to Canada.

John completed his schooling up to Grade 6 before entering the workforce. His career began in Glasgow, where he worked from 1920 to 1925 at Brisbane’s Dairy. In 1925, he emigrated to Montreal, Quebec, where he became a dairy salesman and driver with the Guaranteed Pure Milk Company. Rising through the ranks, he operated as a pasteurization plant operator, earning a steady weekly wage of $92. His skill with vehicles extended to both light and heavy trucks, a valuable asset in his later military role as a driver in the Canadian Army.

Settling into life in Ville LaSalle, Quebec, John married Emily Victoria, with whom he shared a daughter, six-year-old Henriette May. John’s close family also included his brother Easdale, still residing in Lanarkshire, Scotland, and his sister, Mrs. H.C. Whitehead, in Lancashire, England. Despite his busy work life, John found time for sports, enjoying activities like skating, soccer, and softball.

Driven by a deep sense of duty, John enlisted in the Canadian Armed Forces on August 15, 1940, in Montreal. Initially assigned to the 5th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery of the Royal Canadian Artillery (CASF), he transferred to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment on October 26, 1944. His service took him across Canada and to Italy, where he ultimately made the ultimate sacrifice. At 5 feet, 7.5 inches tall, with blue eyes and a sturdy build of 164 pounds, he was known as a loyal and capable soldier, working as a driver and steward in officers’ mess halls.

John’s dream, once the war ended, was to return to Montreal and resume his job at Guaranteed Pure Milk Company, with hopes of one day owning a business of his own. Though he did not live to see this dream realized, his legacy lives on through his family, friends, and comrades. His story, marked by resilience, loyalty, and a quiet ambition, remains a tribute to the many sacrifices made during the war, remembered always in the hearts of those who knew and loved him.

Letter from Henriette, John Sinclair’s daughter
I was born on the morning of February 3, 1939, in Montreal, Quebec.  My mother’s name was Emily Victoria Mary (Read) and my father’s name was John Sinclair.

In February 1941, my mother and I said good bye to John Sinclair.  It was in Windsor Station, Montreal, Quebec.   I never saw him again.  He had joined the army and was being shipped overseas.  (This was World War II time.)

During the next four years, my mother and father exchanged letters, which my mother would read to me.

We lived in Montreal with my Grandparents.  Then in later 1943, we moved to Knowlton, Quebec, waiting, hoping and praying for my father to return from the war.

As a little girl I would dream of the day he, my father, would come home.  He would hug me and I would sit on his knee.

My mother, grandparents and aunt had just finished supper.  We heard the sleigh bells as they got closer to our house.  The doorbell rang. My mother and I went to answer the door.  The man who was driving the horse and sleigh handed my mother an envelope:  it was a telegram.  My mother opened it and began crying.  She said to my Grandmother,
“John has been killed in action.”  That was January 6th, 1945.

My dreams of seeing my Daddy were shattered.  I would never see him again.  We all cried and cried.

Growing up, I always hoped there had been a mistake and that one day he would return.  But of course that never happened.

There was always a loneliness in my heart for the father I never really knew.

I went to school, graduated and then took a 3-year Nursing Diploma training at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal and became an RN (Registered Nurse).

Then in 1963, I married Kingsford Flood.  We had two children, a son, Rory and a daughter, Shelley.  Yet still an emptiness for my father.

That emptiness remained with me and every January 6th, I would really have a loneliness.  The grieving did not lessen but seemed to increase each year.

I was angry with God for many years because my father never came home after the war.  He was killed so far away and in a country I really did not know very much about… this country, Italy.  It was February 14th, 1971.  I heard the Gospel that I could have a relationship with God through His son, Jesus Christ.  On this date, I received Christ as my Saviour.  The heart healing began as I came to know the Heavenly Father and His love.

It was always a plan that one day I would go to Italy and visit my father’s grave.

On May 10th, 2013, I did visit my father’s grave in the Villanova Cemetery.  It was very emotional to stand on the ground where my father was buried.  So many thoughts but finally closure that I had finally come to his resting place to honour him.  The reception of love, kindness and respect from the people so touched my heart and my husband, Kingsford, too.

This is a memory I will cherish always in my heart.

Thank you to everyone who made this time at Villanova so memorable for me.
