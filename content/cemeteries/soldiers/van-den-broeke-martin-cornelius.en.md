Born on July 12, 1921, in Monarch, Alberta, Martin came from a Dutch family with strong ties to the land and manual labor. His father, Gerhard, was a blacksmith, and Martin spent much of his youth working as a farm laborer and blacksmith, helping his father in the shop. He completed Grade 8 at the age of 15 but did not pursue further education, instead dedicating himself to working on the family farm and learning blacksmithing. Martin had a few years of mixed farming experience and also showed competence in tractor and vehicle repairs, although he did not wish to engage in farming after the war.

Martin enlisted in Calgary, Alberta, on December 22, 1942, following a trend where many young men in his community were joining the military. His half-brother, John, was already serving in the 2nd AA Battery of the Royal Canadian Artillery. Martin was fluent in both Dutch and English, and though he was described as sturdy, active, and cooperative, he was noted for not being particularly aggressive but always willing and agreeable.

After enlisting, Martin spent time training in Canada (from December 1942 to August 1943), followed by deployment to the United Kingdom (August to October 1943), and then to Italy, where he served until his death. He showed steady progress in the military, being promoted to Acting Corporal on multiple occasions and achieving the rank of Corporal on September 10, 1944, and later Lance Sergeant on September 17, 1944.

Though not aggressive by nature, Martin enlisted to make a contribution as a fighting man. His military record reflected an intelligent and cooperative nature, which helped him progress through the ranks. He was with the Cape Breton Highlanders from January 19, 1944, until his death nearly a year later. His life and service exemplify the commitment and sacrifice of many young Canadians who served in World War II.

Martinâ€™s family included his half-brother, John, and his sister, Hendricha Nelson, who resided in the United States. His religious background was Dutch Reformed, and he enjoyed sports like hockey and baseball in his leisure time. His post-war ambitions remained undecided, though his experiences as a farm laborer and blacksmith gave him a solid foundation for various trades.
