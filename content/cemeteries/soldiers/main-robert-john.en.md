Private Robert John MAIN was born on December 6, 1924, in Ocean Falls, British Columbia, to parents Robert and Susan. Growing up in a working-class family, Robert experienced a modest and somewhat challenging upbringing. His father was a boilermaker, and his brother worked in shipyards, which was a familiar setting for Robert as well. In his youth, he worked various odd jobs, including positions in a box factory, cannery, and as a pin boy in a bowling alley. Later, he found more steady work as a laborer at the North Vancouver shipyards, holding on during construction—a job that spoke to his strength and resilience.

Robert’s early life wasn’t easy, and he struggled with formal education. He attended South Westminster Public School but left with only a Grade 5 education. Known to be a poor student, he was eventually expelled after a physical altercation with a teacher. School didn’t hold his interest, and he had no inclination toward sports or academic activities. He preferred simpler pleasures—he was an avid swimmer, enjoyed bowling and hunting, and passed time with comic books, radio shows, and heavy smoking. His life was marked by a restlessness and a lack of direction, yet he possessed a strong work ethic and good health, standing at 5’10¼” and weighing 150 pounds.

On December 18, 1942, at the age of 18, Robert enlisted in the Canadian Army in Vancouver, British Columbia. His reasons for joining the military remain unstated, but his enlistment came at a time when young men across the country were feeling the call to serve in World War II. Despite his limited education and lack of self-direction, Robert was noted for his good attitude and stability. His assessors recognized him as an individual with potential, though he was easily influenced by others. With these qualities, he was recommended for service as an infantry rifleman.

Assigned to No. XI District Depot in Vancouver, Robert trained rigorously, adapting to the discipline and demands of military life. In April 1944, he joined the Westminster Regiment, and then the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. His service took him through various theaters of war. He remained in Canada until early 1944, after which he was deployed to the United Kingdom in February, before finally landing in Italy in March of that year. Italy was a brutal front, marked by fierce battles as the Allies fought to push German forces back up the Italian peninsula.

Robert faced his share of hardships in the Italian Campaign. On May 26, 1944, he was injured in combat, though he recovered and returned to his unit, continuing to fight alongside his comrades. Despite the challenging conditions and the brutal realities of warfare, Robert persevered, demonstrating a resilience and bravery that transcended his earlier struggles with direction and purpose.

Tragically, on December 13, 1944, just a week after his 20th birthday, Private Robert John was killed in action. His regiment was engaged in intense fighting in the area of Naviglio Canal and he lost his life as he served his country with courage. He was laid to rest in the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot V, Row A, Grave 7.

Private Robert John Main’s life story reflects the journey of a young man who overcame adversity to serve his country. Though he struggled in his early years, he found purpose and strength in the face of war, ultimately making the ultimate sacrifice. His memory endures as a testament to the resilience and bravery of those who answered the call to serve, even when the path was uncertain.
