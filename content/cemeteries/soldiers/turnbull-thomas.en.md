<br>


Private Thomas TURNBULL of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps (R.C.I.C.), was killed in action on December 14, 1944, during the Italian Campaign in World War II. He is buried at the Villanova War Cemetery, Plot VI, Row C, Grave 9.

Born in South Dumfries, Ontario, on February 19, 1920, Thomas grew up in a large family. He was the fifth child of Orval and Lulu Turnbull, and he had several siblings, including Bruce, Howard, Roy, and sisters Dorothy, Jean, Mildred, Betty, Joyce, and Mary. Some of his sisters were married and living in Trenton and Burwash, Ontario.

Thomas completed Grade 6 before leaving school to work. He was employed as a truck driver and also worked on a mixed farm with his Uncle Fletcher Turnbull in Brantford, Ontario, from 1937 to 1941. His farm work involved various duties, which gave him experience in manual labor and machinery. Standing 5’8” tall and weighing 135 pounds, Thomas had blue eyes and wore glasses for vision correction. His military record describes him as someone who was not a quick thinker and had difficulty with reading and writing.

On May 22, 1941, at the age of 21, Thomas enlisted in Brantford, Ontario, joining the 69th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Canadian Artillery (R.C.A.). He served in Canada from May 22 to August 23, 1941, before being deployed to the United Kingdom on August 24, 1941, where he served until November 14, 1943. He was then sent to Italy, where he fought from November 15, 1943, until his death on December 14, 1944.
From War Record:
During his time in the Italian Campaign, Turnbull’s unit, the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, was engaged in several key battles as part of the 5th Canadian Armoured Division. The regiment played a significant role in the capture of Godo and San Pancrazio, as part of operations to advance from Villanova to the Naviglio Canal. The period of action leading up to his death was marked by heavy fighting and significant achievements in taking enemy-held positions.
Though Thomas faced challenges with literacy, his service and contributions in the war reflected his dedication and resilience. He held a position in his unit as a sanitary laborer and took part in hockey as a recreational activity. His quiet determination and willingness to serve, despite personal obstacles, illustrate the significant role of ordinary soldiers in the efforts of World War II.

Thomas’s family and community remember him as one who gave his life in service to his country, and his sacrifice remains a lasting testament to the commitment of so many Canadian soldiers during the war.
