It was south of the Fosso Munio. His final resting place is in Villanova War Cemetery, in plot VI C 3. 
Sergeant Tompson was honored posthumously with a Mention in Despatches, recognizing his bravery and contribution to the war effort.

Charles grew up in a family of six, the youngest of three brothers—Daniel, Richard, and Walter—and one sister, Ruth Blackman. His father, George Daniele, and mother, Alice, raised their family in Toronto, where Charles lived prior to his enlistment. He completed his education through Grade 12 by the age of 18 and was actively involved in sports, excelling in gymnastics, rugby- where he played as a quarter, and baseball.

In his civilian life, Charles worked as a construction worker and bricklayer for Martin Construction Company in Toronto from 1937 to 1940, earning a weekly wage of $25.00. He also had experience as a milk salesman, working summers from 1937 to 1939 for Cousin’s Dairy in Newmarket, Ontario, where he earned $35.00 a week. Although his farming experience was limited, he expressed a desire to continue working as a milk salesman, indicating a preference for jobs that required interaction and responsibility.

On December 14, 1940, Charles married Irene Mary, and the couple began their life together just as war was escalating in Europe. Charles had already been serving in the Active Militia of Canada with the Governor General’s Horse Guards and felt a strong sense of duty to enlist in full-time military service when the time came. 
He formally enlisted on July 24, 1940, at Camp Borden, joining the 2nd Motorcycle Regiment of the Governor General’s Horse Guards. His military background in the militia, combined with his cooperative and reasonable nature, made him well-suited for leadership roles.

During his time in the military, Charles sought out a range of specialized training and experiences. He attended a Physical Training course in Kingston, Ontario, a Gunnery course in Tidworth, England, and a Lewis Gun Refresher Course in Toronto, Ontario. Additionally, he received special training in the use of the Lewis Gun in 1937 and completed the Sergeant’s Qualification Course in 1940, setting the stage for his promotion to sergeant. Although his original desire was to serve as an RCAF gunner or tank crew commander, he ultimately made his mark in armored reconnaissance.

Sergeant Tompson’s service during World War II spanned three key theaters: Canada (July 24, 1940, to October 6, 1941), the United Kingdom (October 7, 1941, to October 26, 1943), and Italy (October 27, 1943, to December 18, 1944). 
His bravery and leadership were evident during his time with the Governor General’s Horse Guards, where he played a critical role in the unit’s reconnaissance missions in Italy. His actions in combat earned him the Mention in Despatches, a testament to his courage and dedication.

Sadly, Sergeant Charles Gordon Tompson’s life was cut short in December 1944. His sacrifice, along with that of countless others, contributed to the Allied efforts during the war. He is remembered for his service, his leadership, and his ultimate sacrifice for his country.
