+++


Lance Corporal Homer Gilbert Schleihauf served with honor as a member of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps. Known for his amiable personality and dedication, Homer’s life was one of loyalty, service, and sacrifice.

Born on July 12, 1919, in the small town of West Lorne, Elgin, Ontario, Homer grew up in a close-knit family led by his parents, Albert Gilbert and Marion. Homer was one of seven children, with four brothers and two sisters who shared his journey through childhood. 
At age 14, he left school to contribute to the family’s livelihood, working as a laborer at J. McLandress & Sons’ grain elevator in West Lorne. Homer’s early jobs not only demonstrated his work ethic but also the diversity of his skills. From 1938 to 1940, he worked as a bartender at the Homelike Inn in Cobourg, Ontario, where he was known for his warm and welcoming manner. His love for sports—especially bowling, skating, hunting, and catching for his local baseball team—further defined his social and outgoing personality.

Homer married Marion E. and together they welcomed their son, John Gilbert. Despite the challenges of a young family, Homer felt an undeniable sense of duty to serve his country. 
He enlisted on July 24, 1940, at Cobourg, Ontario, joining the 3/47 Field Battery of the Royal Canadian Artillery in the Canadian Active Service Force (CASF). Standing at 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing 165 pounds, with striking grey eyes and a friendly demeanor, Homer’s presence brought a sense of camaraderie to those around him.

Following his enlistment, Homer’s journey began in Canada, where he served until September 18, 1941. From there, he embarked on the next phase of his military career in the United Kingdom, arriving on September 19, 1941. His deployment in the UK marked the beginning of intense preparation for active combat, during which he developed skills in various roles, including serving as a waiter in the officers’ mess.

By October 27, 1943, Homer was deployed to Italy, where he would join the grueling campaigns in some of the most intense battlegrounds of the Second World War. On October 26, 1944, his regiment was redesignated as the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, a unit that soon saw extensive action in the Italian theater. As a Lance Corporal, Homer proved his dedication and leadership within his unit, showing a steadfast commitment to his comrades and mission.

Tragically, on December 13, 1944, Homer’s service came to a heartbreaking end. He was killed in action at age 24 during fierce fighting in Italy, as his regiment engaged in one of many critical operations in the region. Homer Gilbert Schleihaus was laid to rest at the Villanova War Cemetery, where he lies in Plot VII, Row C, Grave 3, his memory enshrined among the ranks of fellow soldiers who gave their lives for their country.

Lance Corporal Schleihaus’s legacy is one of courage, humility, and selflessness. His story lives on through his son, John, and the many family members and friends who remember him as a beloved husband, father, and comrade. 
His service to Canada remains a testament to the countless young men and women who answered the call of duty during World War II.
