Walter Henry Goodall’s story is one of service, skill, and sacrifice, reflecting the journey of a young man who left behind his home in British Columbia to fight for freedom during the Second World War. 
Born on January 25, 1921, in Lynn Valley, BC, Walter was the youngest of three children in a close-knit family. His parents, Albert Edward and Gertrude Anne Goodall, had married in Cardiff, South Wales, in 1918 before moving to Canada. Walter grew up alongside his older brother Ernest Albert and his sister Pamela Jane, as well as a half-sister, Eveline.

Walter’s childhood was described as happy, and he showed a natural curiosity and aptitude for technical subjects. After completing grade 9, he pursued various occupations, first working on his father’s mixed farm in White Rock, BC, from 1936 to 1940, earning $10 a week. Later, he became a diesel crane operator at the Burrard Dry Dock Company in North Vancouver, where he earned a significantly higher wage of $50 a week. Walter’s work at the shipyard demonstrated his mechanical skill and reliability, qualities that would shape his contributions to the war effort.

In addition to his work, Walter enjoyed reading technical books and playing sports, including swimming, football, and soccer, where he excelled as a winger. He also played the mouth organ, showcasing his lighter, artistic side. Standing 5’8” tall and weighing 155 pounds, with blue eyes, Walter was physically fit and prepared for the rigors of military service.

On July 25, 1941, at the age of 20, Walter enlisted in the Canadian Army at Williams Lake, BC. Initially assigned to No. 11 District Depot, he displayed a keen interest in technical fields, completing courses in power electricity, welding, wireless communication, and driving and maintenance. Despite his aptitude, his army career was marked by frequent reassignment, with Walter moving from one course to another without fully utilizing his skills. Described as flippant about his career, he lacked clarity about his standing in the army. Nevertheless, his potential as an electrician or welder was noted, and his superiors recommended these roles for him.

After completing training in Canada, Walter was deployed to the United Kingdom on October 28, 1942, and to Italy on October 27, 1943, as part of the Governor General’s Horse Guards (3rd Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment). This unit played a critical role in reconnaissance and support operations during the Italian Campaign, a grueling series of battles against determined German forces in challenging terrain.

Tragically, Walter’s service came to an end on January 4, 1945, when he succumbed to wounds sustained in combat during operations in Italy. 
He was just 24 years old. His loss was deeply felt by his family in Canada and his comrades on the battlefield.

Trooper Walter Henry Goodall was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot I, Row A, Grave 5. His grave serves as a lasting tribute to his service and sacrifice, a reminder of the courage displayed by so many young Canadians during the war.

Walter’s story is one of unfulfilled potential and ultimate sacrifice. From his technical skills and early promise to his service in one of the war’s most demanding campaigns, he exemplified the resilience and dedication of his generation. 
Though his life was tragically brief, Trooper Walter Henry Goodall’s legacy endures in the hearts of his family and the annals of history, honoring his contribution to the fight for freedom.
