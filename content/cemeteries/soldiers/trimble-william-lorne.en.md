#### Perth Regiment, R.C.I.C.
<br>


William Lorne TRIMBLE served with the Perth Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps during World War II. 
Born on March 24, 1915, in Windsor, Ontario, he was 31 years old when he was killed in action on December 20, 1944, at the S bend along via Chiara. 
His final resting place is in the Villanova War Cemetery, at plot IV B I.

Before the war, William grew up in a challenging environment. His father passed away when William was just two years old, and he was raised by his mother, Phyllis, who later remarried, becoming Mrs. Powell. He also had a half-sister named Jeanne Powell. William’s early life was shaped by his upbringing in Windsor, Ontario, where he later settled and worked.

William attended school until Grade VII but left at the age of 16, just before taking his exams. Despite his average academic performance, he was particularly skilled in subjects like grammar, reading, and art. Leaving school was not a choice made lightly but a necessity, as he left to help his family on the farm. His work life began with seasonal employment as hired help on market gardens during the summer and farming through the winters. He also worked as a laborer and eventually found employment as a fireman with the Canadian Pacific Railway in Windsor, earning $45 a week. He had been working for CPR for about a year before being called up for military service.

On June 9, 1943, William Trimble enlisted in the army at Windsor, Ontario. He was called to serve, not out of choice, but duty. His service took him through various theaters of war, starting in Canada from June 9, 1943, to December 14, 1943. He was then transferred to the UK where he served until March 27, 1944. Finally, he was deployed to Italy, where he fought bravely from March 28, 1944, until his death on December 20, 1944. 
He was wounded in action on December 13, 1944, in the battle of the Naviglio Canal just a week before he was killed.

Physically, William stood 6 feet and half an inch tall and weighed 175 pounds. He had blue eyes and was always neatly dressed with a good appearance. Though described as somewhat nervous and quiet, William was a man of resolve, determined to serve. His “M” score, used to measure aptitude in the military, was at the threshold of average, but those who evaluated him felt he had more potential than this score suggested. He had hoped to serve as a fireman in the Canadian Railway troops, but when enlistment for that unit ceased, he accepted his fate in the infantry. Although nervous, his dedication and sense of duty led him to become part of the non-tradesman group in the infantry, where he fought valiantly until the end.

Private William Lorne Trimble left behind his wife, Blanche Mildred, who remained in Windsor, Ontario, during the war. His story is one of quiet determination, a man who served out of obligation but gave everything in the defense of his country.
