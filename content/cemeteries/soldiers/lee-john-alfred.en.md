John Alfred LEE, Perth Regiment in the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, was a man of resilience, dedication, and strength. 

Born on November 16, 1918, in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, John was raised in challenging circumstances. His mother, Edna, passed away when he was a baby, and his father moved to Pontiac, Michigan, leaving John and his two sisters, Elsie and Edith, to grow up with a sense of independence and self-reliance. Despite this early loss, John’s childhood was marked by the strong bond he shared with his sisters, particularly Edith, who would go on to serve with the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps in England during the war.

John spent much of his youth and early adulthood working as a farm laborer, gaining extensive experience across the plains of southern Saskatchewan. With a tall, solid frame—standing at 5 feet 11 ¼ inches and weighing 218 pounds—John was well-suited for the demanding work of farming, which instilled in him both strength and a practical skill set. By the time of his enlistment, he had developed a range of farming skills, driving trucks, autos, and tractors, with aspirations of one day owning his own farm.

On September 17, 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, John enlisted in Listowel, Ontario, driven by a strong sense of patriotism. He initially joined the 100th Field Battery of the Royal Canadian Artillery (R.C.A.), where he trained as a gunner. 
His military service took him through Canada and, eventually, to the United Kingdom, where he served as a limber gunner in the 45th Battery, handling artillery equipment and undergoing rigorous training. However, John’s journey in the army was not without challenges. 
In mid-1944, while stationed in England, he served time in a Canadian Detention Barracks for an incident involving violence toward a superior officer. Despite this setback, he completed his sentence and was remustered to the Canadian Infantry Corps in September 1944, ready to resume his duties with renewed determination.

During his time in the military, John remained connected to his family. He was married to Margaret Alice, with whom he had a son. Margaret, who split her time between Quill Lake, Saskatchewan, and New Westminster, British Columbia, supported John’s service wholeheartedly. Her health was stable, and she was cooperative regarding his deployment, a support that no doubt brought John comfort as he faced the uncertainties of wartime service.

John’s final deployment came in November 1944, when he was sent to Italy as part of the Allied campaign. He joined the Perth Regiment, which was engaged in intense and grueling battles across the Italian front. John’s experience as a gunner and farm laborer likely contributed to his adaptability in the field, where he took on the demands of infantry service with quiet determination.

Beyond his military role, John had a love for outdoor activities. He enjoyed swimming, canoeing, and playing softball, particularly infield positions, which gave him a sense of camaraderie and physical resilience. Known for his solid, steadfast demeanor, John was a man who took pride in his work and looked forward to building a future with his family after the war.

Sadly, that future would never come to be. On December 20, 1944, Private John Alfred Lee was killed in action in Italy, one of many young men whose lives were cut short in the fight for freedom. He was just 26 years old, leaving behind his wife, young son, and two sisters, who would forever remember his strength, dedication, and unwavering spirit.

Today, John rests in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot IV, Row A, Grave 4. 
His grave stands as a tribute to a man who, despite the hardships and complexities of his life, gave everything in service to his country. 
John’s story, marked by resilience and sacrifice, remains a powerful reminder of the courage and humanity of those who served.
