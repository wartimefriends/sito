Private Leo John MALLEY was born on November 27, 1921, in Chatham Head, New Brunswick. A man of Roman Catholic faith and steadfast dedication, he was raised in a large family by his parents, Peter and Elizabeth Vatour. As the eldest among his siblings, he shared his life with two brothers, Edmund and Archibald, and three sisters, Cecelia, Janet, and Leona, as well as several half-siblings. His family background was stable, and he grew up in a supportive environment in the small, close-knit community of Chatham Head. Later, he married Ruby Carmel of Lower Newcastle, New Brunswick, though they did not have children.

Leo completed his schooling through grade 8 and subsequently worked as a laborer for local employers around Chatham Head. Standing 5’10” and weighing 180 pounds, with hazel eyes and a good-natured personality, he possessed a solid and physically capable build, well-suited for the demands of military service. Although he displayed a mild eye squint, his physical and mental fitness were rated positively.

When Canada entered World War II, Leo John enlisted on September 8, 1939, in Newcastle, New Brunswick, inspired by the decision of his friends to join the fight. He began his service in the 28th Field Battery and quickly adapted to military life. Initially stationed in Canada, he was sent to the United Kingdom on December 14, 1940, where he continued his service before moving on to Italy in November 1943. Although not eager for promotions, Leo John Malley was a contented and cooperative soldier, showing a quiet commitment and satisfaction in his role in the 1st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, 89th Battery, RCA.

On October 26, 1944, Leo was redesignated to serve with the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, and he continued to fight alongside his comrades in Italy. 
His last days were spent engaged in the difficult and grueling Italian Campaign, where he demonstrated resilience and duty to his regiment and country. 
Tragically, on January 6, 1945, Private Leo John Malley was killed in action, just shy of his 24th birthday. 
He was laid to rest at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot I C 9.

Private Malley’s’s life and service reflect a deep-rooted loyalty to his community, family, and fellow soldiers. Remembered for his steady presence and willingness to serve, he left behind a legacy of quiet courage and sacrifice, embodying the values of dedication and honor that he held dear. 
His wife, family, and community continue to honor his memory, cherishing his contributions and the ultimate sacrifice he made.



06 January 1945

The two “Leos” A Miramichi soldier died in Italy.
Leo John Malley enlisted in the active army alongside his boyhood friend, Leo Joseph Henry, on 8 September 1939, in Newcastle – two days before Canada officially declared war on Germany.
Leo John Malley, the son of Peter and Elizabeth (Vatoure) Malley, was born in Chatham Head on 27 November 1921. He was working at Frasers Mill when he enlisted in the active army (he had prior reserve force service with the 28th Field Battery, RCA.) Eighteen-year-old Leo Malley married Ruby Carmel Savoy, of Lower Newcastle, on 13 March 1940 at St Mary’s in Newcastle. Leo arrived in England on 26 December. 
On 11 April, 1941, he was transferred to the 1st Light Anti-Aircraft Regt, RCA – a unit that was re-designated and re-organized many times as the Canadian army adapted to the battlefield in Italy : it became the 1st Canadian (Lanark and Renfrew) LAA Regt, and then the 1st Light Anti-Aircraft Infantry Battalion – The Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment (infantry using anti-aircraft guns in close ground support). Malley arrived in Italy on 26 November 1943.
Private Leo John Malley was killed in action on 6 January 1945, during the fighting to cross the Senio River (the Gothic Line). He is buried in grave 1C9 in the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery and is commemorated on the Newcastle cenotaph.
Leo Joseph Henry survived the war and later married his friend’s widow. Carmel Hambrook gives us more of this story: “Ruby Carmel Savoy was my mother. She married Leo Joseph Henry, Leo John Malley's best friend, on May 28, 1946. The two Leos joined at the same time and fought together in the same battles. Even after all these years, both families have considered ourselves as family.”
On 23 October 1944 Leo had applied for compassionate leave to return home to Ruby who had had a number of medical issues. His request was supported by the brigade Padre. The request was then passed along to Divisional HQ, 1 Canadian Corps HQ and then to Canadian Army HQ in London. It reached Ottawa on 8 November and a request was sent to the sheriff in Newcastle to investigate the request. Deputy Sheriff Keith Copp replied to Ottawa on 15 January 1945 that Ruby had been ill and had undergone a neck operation in the spring of 1943 and an appendectomy in February 1944. Upon receiving the deputy sheriff’s report, the authorities in Ottawa, knowing that Leo had been killed on 6 January, realised that the family had not been notified of his death due to the legal restraints of the investigation. The investigation was immediately stopped and Ruby learned of her husband’s death on 18 January.
