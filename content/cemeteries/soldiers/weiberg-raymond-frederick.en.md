title = "Private Raymond Frederick WEIBERG was born to Karl and Della Weiberg and grew up in a modest family alongside his brother Lorne and his sister Carrie Kuzmick. Life was shaped by the values of hard work and dedication, principles that would guide him throughout his journey. As a young man, he completed his education up to Grade 4, which was typical in his rural setting. Although he attempted to progress further, the limitations of his local school environment led him to leave school at the age of 14. He then turned to the land, where he found his calling as a farm laborer."

Working the fields became both his livelihood and his passion. Over the next nine years, he gained extensive experience in mixed farming, most recently employed by Mrs. J.H. Patrick in Ilderton, Ontario. His skills on the farm were not limited to just tilling the soil; he also had a knack for tinkering with machinery, finding joy in understanding how things worked. Despite his dedication to farming, he found it difficult to carve out time for sports or social life. His focus remained on his duties, not seeking distraction but instead channeling his energy into his work.

In the spring of 1942, he made the life-changing decision to enlist in the Canadian Army, seeking both opportunity and a chance to serve his country during a time of global upheaval. On April 9, 1942, he signed up at the enlistment center in Kitchener, Ontario, joining the No. 10 Basic Training Centre. His straightforward demeanor and cheerful manner caught the attention of his instructors, who noted his robust build and his potential as a rifleman. Although he had no clear preference for a specific military job, his experience with rough carpentry and machinery hinted at skills that could be useful beyond the infantry.

Just a few months after enlisting, in October 1942, he married Elizabeth Mary-Ailsa Craig in Ontario. Though he found army life to be a good fit, there was a shadow over his happiness; his wifeâ€™s poor health weighed on his mind as he prepared for the realities of overseas service.

After undergoing extensive training in Canada, including time at Borden and with the Scots Fusiliers at Niagara, he was deemed ready for the challenges ahead. He was described by his superiors as a short but solid soldier, one who had made a seamless transition to army life despite his earlier educational struggles. His Pulhems profile indicated he was fit for deployment, and in July 1944, he was recommended for General Duty overseas.

His journey took him across three theaters of service. He trained and served in Canada from his enlistment in April 1942 until August 1944, before being sent to the United Kingdom. He stayed in the UK from late August until September 1944, preparing for the next stage of his military journey. By September 20, 1944, he was in Italy, where he would face some of the most grueling challenges of the war as part of the Perth Regiment.

During his service in Italy, he was noted for his capability as a rifleman, always alert and much sharper in action than his initial evaluations had suggested. Though his conduct sheet remained clear and his attitude cheerful, the realities of war were ever-present. His dedication to his duty and his willingness to adapt to the harsh conditions of the battlefield stood out to those who served alongside him.

Throughout his military career, he remained grounded in his rural roots, maintaining the same straightforward and robust character he had developed as a farm laborer. While he harbored a hope of one day returning to the quiet life of farming in Ontario, his journey took him to the front lines, where his skills and perseverance were put to the ultimate test.

Despite the challenges he faced, he continued to show a willingness to serve wherever he was needed, embodying the spirit of resilience and dedication that defined so many of his generation. His story is one of transformation from a young farmer to a soldier who met his duties head-on, driven by a quiet determination and a steadfast commitment to both his family and his country.

Raymond was killed in action on December 20th, 1944 at the age of 24, along via Chiara while fighting in the attempt to reach the right bank of the Senio River.

He rests in Plot IV, Row A, Grave 7 at the Villanova War cemetery with many other Canadian brave young men. May he rest in Peace!
