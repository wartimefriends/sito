Private Norman Forward Hartley’s story is one of dedication, resilience, and service, reflecting the life of a man who left behind a young family to fight for freedom during one of history’s darkest hours. 
Born on December 18, 1914, in Toronto, Ontario, Norman grew up in a close-knit family. He was the second of seven children born to John William and Nora Jane Hartley, with siblings George Arnold, Elgin Herbert, Fredrick Gerald, Clifford Wilbert, Hazel Margaret, and Lorraine Marion. Norman’s upbringing was shaped by the hardships of the era, and he left school partway through grade six to help support his widowed mother.

Norman was described as a likable and observant man with a pleasant manner. Of tall and slender build, standing at 5’11” and weighing 149 pounds, he possessed a wiry strength and an alert demeanor. He was noted for his frankness, agreeable nature, and average learning ability. 
Before enlisting, Norman worked as a rancher on a sheep farm in British Columbia for two and a half years before returning to Toronto in 1942.

On July 18, 1941, Norman married Eva May, and the couple welcomed their son, Gary Ralph, on September 12, 1943. 
Despite the responsibilities of a young family, Norman felt the call of duty and enlisted in the Canadian Army on February 1, 1943, in Toronto, Ontario. 
His older brother, George Arnold, was already serving with the Irish Regiment of Canada, and his brother Elgin was also enlisted in the Canadian Active Service Force (CASF), reflecting a family deeply committed to the war effort.

After completing basic training, Norman was assigned to the Number 2 District Depot and later posted overseas. His military journey took him to the United Kingdom on September 14, 1943, where he continued his training and preparations for active service. 
On November 4, 1944, Norman arrived in Italy, joining the Irish Regiment of Canada as part of the Allied forces engaged in the grueling Italian Campaign.

The Italian Campaign was marked by harsh conditions and fierce battles as Allied troops fought to liberate Italy from German occupation. Norman’s regiment faced relentless challenges, including the bitter fighting in the wetlands and rivers of northern Italy. On December 21, 1944, Norman officially joined C Company of the Irish Regiment in Italy, ready to contribute to the effort.

Tragically, Norman’s service was cut short on January 2, 1945, during operations near Mezzano, Italy, in the area of San Alberto. He was killed in action, leaving behind his wife and young son. Norman was just 30 years old.

Private Norman Forward Hartley was laid to rest in the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot II, Row B, Grave 5. 
His grave, along with those of his comrades, stands as a solemn reminder of the cost of war and the bravery of those who gave their lives in the pursuit of peace and freedom.

Norman’s story is one of selflessness and devotion, from his commitment to his family to his sacrifice for his country. He exemplified the courage and resilience of a generation that rose to meet the challenges of war. 
Though his life was tragically brief, his memory endures in the hearts of his loved ones and in the annals of history.
