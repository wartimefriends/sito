Joseph Traies Fuller was born on February 18, 1925, in Kingsville, Ontario, to Eva Traies and Frederick John Fuller. His father passed away in 1932, leaving Eva to provide for their family of nine children by working as a restaurant cook. Despite the challenges, the Fullers were a wholesome, close-knit family. Joseph had four brothers—Frederick, Edward, Norman, and Douglas (who served in the Royal Canadian Navy)—and three sisters, Lena (Taylor), Margaret, and Maude. Another brother, Lennard, had passed away before him.

Joseph was a bright and promising young man who excelled in his studies, completing Grade VIII at Kingsville Public School and attending high school for four years, achieving a junior matriculation. Science and mathematics were his favorite subjects, and he was fond of school. 
However, in 1943, at just 18 years old, he left school to enlist in the Canadian Army, motivated by a deep sense of patriotism.

From an early age, Joseph displayed a natural aptitude for mechanics and a curious mind. He spent summers working for local farmers and cutting neighbors’ lawns, building model airplanes, and enjoying sports like softball, track, gymnastics, and general athletics. He was a member of the school softball team and a Boy Scout for two years. Quiet, alert, and friendly, Joseph preferred the comfort of home to bustling crowds and had a strong interest in tinkering with cars, hoping to one day train as a driver-mechanic.

Joseph’s military journey began on June 1, 1943, when he enlisted at Windsor, Ontario, joining the No. 1 District Depot General List. With a solid foundation in military training from four years in school cadets—three of those as a platoon commander—he was well-prepared for service. He also completed a six-week course with the Essex Scottish Militia in 1943 and attempted to enlist in the R.C.A.F. in November 1942, though he declined a position as a gunner.

Standing 5’8” tall and weighing 135 pounds, Joseph was described as a youth of high ability and strong potential, with leadership qualities that could develop further through training. He did not drink or smoke and was praised for his quiet demeanor, engaging manner, and enthusiasm for the military.

In April 1944, Joseph was deployed overseas, serving briefly in the United Kingdom before joining the Italian Campaign in May 1944 as part of the grueling Allied effort to liberate Italy. Initially assigned to the 48th Highlanders of Canada and later the 1 LAA Regiment, he was transferred to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment in October 1944.

The Italian Campaign was marked by relentless combat in harsh conditions. On December 13, 1944, during operations near Villanova, Italy, Joseph was killed in action at just 19 years old. His life and service were tragically cut short, leaving behind a grieving family who deeply felt his loss.

Lance Corporal Joseph Traies Fuller rests in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, a solemn tribute to his bravery and sacrifice. His legacy lives on in the memories of his family and the history of those who gave their lives in the fight for freedom.

Joseph’s journey, from a young boy with a passion for learning and mechanics to a soldier fighting for his country, reflects the resilience, dedication, and quiet heroism of his generation. 
His story stands as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by so many in the pursuit of peace.
