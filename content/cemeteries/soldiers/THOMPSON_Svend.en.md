Private Swend Aage THOMPSON was born on February 26, 1912, in Bronderslee Aastrup, Denmark, a country that would eventually fall under Nazi occupation. 
At the time of his enlistment, he was living in Canmore, Alberta, working as both a farmer and lumberjack. Though single, Swend had a strong connection to his family, particularly his Uncle Carl Peterson, who resided in Hayter, Alberta. 
His parents, Christen and Anna, remained in occupied Denmark, and Swend had not heard from them since the invasion, according to his uncle. 
He also had three brothers in Denmark, though documentation on his sisters is incomplete.

Swend grew up in a modest family, the third of five children. His childhood was described as good, marked by a love for sports like hunting and soccer, where he played as a left wing. 
He left school at the age of 14 and quickly adapted to working life. Between 1932 and 1940, he was employed as a farm laborer for his uncle and also worked as a lumberjack for Western Construction Company in White Court, Alberta. His weekly wage was $12.50, a modest income for the time, but it gave him valuable experience in both grain farming and lumbering.

On May 31, 1940, Swend enlisted in Calgary, Alberta, joining the Canadian Infantry Corps (CIC), Royal Canadian Artillery (RCA), motivated by a strong sense of duty. 
He was 5’9”high, weighing 165 lbs, with blue eyes and a noticeable Danish accent, Swend was described as having a strong physique despite being somewhat slow-moving and prone to nervousness. His hands were often shaky, and he had difficulty expressing himself in English, though his overall deportment, appearance, and disposition were considered satisfactory.

After completing his initial training in Canada, Swend was deployed to the UK on December 15, 1940, where he would serve for the next few years. He disembarked in Glasgow, Scotland on Christmas Day, 1940. His unit was redesignated as part of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps on October 26, 1944. By this time, Swend had already been sent to Italy, where he arrived on February 20, 1944, to participate in the grueling Italian Campaign during World War II.

Swend fought bravely alongside his comrades, but on December 14, 1944, he was killed in action. 

He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, in Italy, in Plot VI, Row B, Grave 1.
 
His ultimate sacrifice in the war against tyranny remains a testament to his dedication and sense of duty, a life cut short but lived in service to both Canada and the broader fight for freedom during one of history’s darkest periods.
