Private Robert Walter Smith was born on October 17, 1922, in North Sydney, Nova Scotia. Growing up in a supportive family, Robert was the son of Stephen and Winnifred Smith, with one sister, Mrs. Annette Howard. He had a normal home life, but the responsibilities of family life weighed heavily on him. At the age of 15, he left school to help support his parents, marking the beginning of his journey into the workforce.

Robert’s early employment included two years as a delivery boy at Carrolli’s Groceries from 1937 to 1939. He then transitioned to the Steel Company of Canada in Hamilton, where he worked for three and a half years as a steel inspector. His last position before enlisting was as a crane driver, albeit for only a month. Throughout his youth, Robert had been involved in the Sea Cadets for six years, where he distinguished himself by achieving the rank of leading seaman and later becoming the leading drummer.

On October 13, 1942, driven by a strong sense of duty and patriotism, Robert enlisted in the Canadian Army in Hamilton, Ontario. He was assigned to the No. 2 District Depot (AF) Infantry, and after completing his initial training, he transferred to the Westminster Regiment (Motor) on September 5, 1944. His military training took him across Canada, the United Kingdom, and ultimately to Italy, where he would see the harsh realities of war.

Robert served in Canada from October 13, 1942, to April 8, 1943, followed by a stint in the UK from April 9, 1943, to March 25, 1944. He arrived in Italy on March 26, 1944, where he would continue to fight alongside his fellow soldiers. Robert was known for his rugged physique and good health, standing 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighing 165 pounds. He had brown eyes and black hair, and he did not drink or smoke. Described as a solid and steady individual, he was frank and straightforward, showing sincerity and agreeableness during interviews. Robert also demonstrated a fair aptitude for map reading and average military knowledge.

In addition to his military pursuits, Robert had a passion for sports, playing rugby and participating in track competitions. He was also a skilled skater and swimmer, and his lifelong hobby was horseback riding. With aspirations of becoming a paratrooper, Robert sought to enlist in this elite branch but was informed at the recruiting center in Hamilton that he would first need to complete his regular training before applying for paratrooper status. He had flown in an airplane six or seven times and enjoyed the experience, fueling his desire to jump from them as a paratrooper.

Tragically, Robert’s life was cut short when he was killed in action on December 14, 1944, while serving in Italy at the young age of 22. 
He was directly buried into Villanova War Cemetery by Hon Capt D.R.G.Owen Padre of the Westminster Regiment. He rests in plot VII A 5. 
His sacrifice is remembered not only by his family and friends but also by the nation he served so valiantly.
