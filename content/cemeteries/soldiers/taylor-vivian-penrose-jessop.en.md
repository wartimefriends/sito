Born on February 9, 1922, in Parry Sound, Ontario, Vivian Penrose Jessop Taylor was raised in a family with deep-rooted values. He was the youngest  son of George Henry and Leo Jessop, and had three brothers, Leopold,Dennis and Hal as well as three sisters, Yvonne Jackson, Mrs. Daintry McGonigue and Zoe. His brother Hal was MIA  while flying over the Mediterranean in 1943.

At the time of his enlistment, Taylor was living in Toronto, where he worked as a stock room clerk. He had married Marion Faith from Thornhill, Ontario, and they had a daughter, Gwendolyn June.

Vivian Taylor enlisted in the Canadian Army on August 7, 1942, in Toronto. Having previously served in the Algonquin Regiment from August 1938 to August 1941, he brought with him valuable military experience. His early service with the 2nd District Depot (AF) Canadian Armoured Corps marked the beginning of his formal military journey during World War II. Taylor quickly showed his capabilities and leadership potential, rising through the ranks.

Taylor was posted in Canada until July 20, 1943, before being deployed to the United Kingdom. He served there from July 21 to October 24, 1943, before continuing on to Italy, where he saw active combat from October 25, 1943, until his death in December 1944.

By September 1944, Sergeant Taylor was serving with the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (PLDG), a renowned reconnaissance regiment of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. On September 24, 1944, during an advance on San Vito, his troop came under heavy enemy fire near the village of Variano. When the troop commander and several others were severely wounded, Lance Sergeant Taylor took command of the unit despite being wounded himself. He crossed 500 yards of open terrain under intense shellfire to seek assistance from one of their tanks. Taylor personally directed the tankâ€™s fire on an enemy machine gun position, inflicting heavy casualties and enabling the troop to continue its advance. Despite being wounded again in the arm, he disregarded the dangers, reorganized his troop under heavy mortar fire, and led them with unwavering determination. His actions that day were pivotal to the success of the operation.
For his extraordinary bravery and devotion to duty, Taylor was awarded the Military Medal. His leadership, quick thinking, and selfless actions during intense combat exemplified the highest traditions of military service.

Tragically, Sergeant Vivian Penrose Jessop Taylor was killed in action on December 19, 1944, between Canale Naviglio and Fosso Munio. He was only 22 years old. 
He is buried in Villanova War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot V, Row C, Grave 7. 

His legacy lives on, not only through his family but also through his heroism, which continues to inspire future generations.
