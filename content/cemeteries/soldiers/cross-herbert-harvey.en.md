Private Herbert Harvey Cross was born on August 18, 1924, in Glenavon, Saskatchewan, into a large and loving family. The son of Harvey Thomas and Laura Beatrice Cross, Herbert was one of fourteen children, including four brothers—Gordon, Trooper Howard, Private Norman, and Gerald—and nine sisters, among them Merita (Darcey), Alma (Leech), Evelyn (Forbes), Private Jean Cross, Irene, Ruth, Iva, Eunice, and Shirley. Despite the losses of two sisters in childhood, Herbert grew up in a close-knit and supportive family environment.

Raised on a farm, Herbert completed Grade 8 at Glenavon School before leaving to work as a farmhand to help support his family. He earned $11 a week with board, reflecting his strong work ethic and commitment to his community. 
Known for his bright and stable personality, Herbert enjoyed skating, playing hockey as a center, and baseball. He also participated in local dances, enjoyed social events, and spent time listening to the radio.

At 5’9½” tall and weighing 151 pounds, Herbert was described as a healthy and cheerful young man with hazel eyes and a good attitude. His upbringing on the family farm instilled in him a sense of responsibility and resilience, qualities that would later define his military service.

Motivated by a sense of duty, Herbert enlisted in the Canadian Army on January 8, 1943, in Regina, Saskatchewan. He began his training with the 12th District Depot and expressed a strong desire to join the South Saskatchewan Regiment (SSR), where one of his brothers served. 
However, his skills and adaptability led him to be assigned to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (PLDG), a reconnaissance regiment.

Herbert’s military journey began in Canada before he was deployed to the United Kingdom in October 1943. 
In January 1944, he joined the Italian Campaign, one of the most demanding theaters of the Second World War. Known for their role in reconnaissance and frontline support, the PLDG played a vital part in the Allied effort to liberate Italy.

Herbert’s service was tragically cut short on December 13, 1944, during intense combat near Villa Prati. He was just 20 years old.

Private Herbert Harvey Cross was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot V, Row B, Grave 8. His grave stands as a solemn reminder of the courage and sacrifice of a young man who gave his life in the pursuit of freedom.

Herbert’s story is one of dedication, resilience, and selflessness. From his humble beginnings on a Saskatchewan farm to the battlefields of Italy, he exemplified the qualities of his generation: duty, courage, and an unwavering commitment to a better future.

Though his life was tragically brief, Herbert’s legacy lives on in the hearts of his family and the history of the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards. 
His sacrifice reminds us of the immense cost of war and the profound impact of those who served with honor. 
Herbert Harvey Cross’s life serves as a tribute to the ordinary individuals who made extraordinary sacrifices for freedom and peace.
