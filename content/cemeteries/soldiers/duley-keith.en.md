A Life of Service and Sacrifice

Private Keith Duley, born on February 16, 1920, in Middlesex, England, grew up in a family shaped by resilience and community. The second of three children, Keith moved to Stratford, Ontario, with his parents, Arthur and Nellie, and his sisters, Nellie and Grace. His upbringing was modest but fulfilling, marked by eight years of public schooling in Stratford, where he excelled in woodwork and sports.

Keith was a tall, strong young man, standing 6 feet tall and weighing 164 pounds. With brown eyes and a friendly demeanor, he was known for his cooperative nature and adventurous spirit. From a young age, Keith displayed a strong work ethic, taking on jobs as a delivery boy and clerk at Dominion Stores and as a veneer matcher at McLagan Furniture Factory. He even worked briefly as a waiter at a local fish-and-chip shop. His ambition was to become a motor mechanic, and he pursued specialized training in woodworking at night school to improve his skills.

Despite his aspirations, Keith’s thirst for adventure led him to enlist in the Canadian Army on September 5, 1939, in Stratford, Ontario. He joined the Perth Regiment - Machine Gun, driven by a desire to experience the world beyond his small-town roots. For Keith, military service was not just a duty—it was an opportunity to seek the adventure he had always craved.
 Keith had already been serving in the Non-Permanent Active Militia, and his transition to active duty was seamless.

Keith’s military service took him across continents and into the heart of the Second World War. His journey began with training in Canada from September 1939 to October 1941, followed by deployment to the United Kingdom. For two years, he prepared for the rigors of combat, finally arriving in Italy on October 27, 1943, to join the Allied forces in one of the most grueling campaigns of the war.

Italy tested Keith’s resilience and courage. He endured the harsh conditions of the Italian Campaign, serving with distinction alongside his comrades. 
On September 13, 1944, Keith was wounded in action and admitted to the 14th Canadian General Hospital the next day. After nearly a month of recovery, he returned to duty, demonstrating his unyielding determination to see the mission through.

Tragically, Keith’s service came to an end on December 20, 1944, when he was killed in action near the Fosso Munio during intense combat operations. He was just 24 years old. 
Keith’s sacrifice was a devastating loss to his family, who had eagerly awaited his return, and to the community that had watched him grow into a dedicated young man.

Private Keith Duley was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, Plot IV, Row C, Grave 1. His grave stands as a solemn reminder of the price of freedom and the courage of those who fought for it.

Keith’s life, though tragically brief, was one of service, resilience, and unwavering commitment to his comrades and country. From the quiet streets of Stratford to the battlefields of Italy, he exemplified the qualities of his generation: selflessness, bravery, and the hope for a brighter future.

His memory endures in the hearts of those who knew him and in the legacy of the Perth Regiment. 
Keith Duley’s story reminds us of the sacrifices made by so many to preserve the freedoms we cherish today.
