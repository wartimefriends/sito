#### Irish Regiment of Canada
<br>


Born on July 13, 1924, in Howland Township, Manitoulin District, Ontario, James was the second of fourteen children in the family of John and Lula May Howard. Growing up in a large, tight-knit family, James shared his home with his five brothers—Alfred John, Wilbert, Lawrence, George William, and Leonard Russell—and his eight sisters—Frances Eleanor, Justina, Dorothy Jean, Doris Margaret, Rita Jacqueline, Maude Marie, and Betty Jane.

James spent his early years on the family farm, where he developed a strong work ethic and a love for reading and hunting. Described as a well-built young man with a pleasing manner, James was known for his stable and enthusiastic personality. After completing Grade 8, he left school at the age of 15 to contribute to the household. He found work as a miner and smelter laborer at the International Nickel Company in Sudbury, Ontario, where he performed general duties with diligence.

By July 1942, James felt ready for a new challenge. Seeking adventure and disillusioned with civilian life, he enlisted in the Canadian Army on July 19, 1942, in Sudbury, Ontario. Standing 5’9” and weighing 172.5 pounds, with fair skin, brown eyes, and brown hair, he brought physical strength and determination to his new role. His military career began with the Number 2 District Depot General List before being assigned to the Canadian Armoured Corps, where he served with the 8th Hussars.

On December 12, 1942, James was deployed to the United Kingdom, where he continued training and preparation for frontline service. By November 1944, he had been transferred to the Canadian Infantry Corps and posted to the Irish Regiment of Canada. 
He arrived in Italy on November 4, 1944, joining the fierce and grueling Italian Campaign.

James was well-suited for the challenges of military life. With experience in driving trucks and cars and a bit of mechanical know-how, he contributed both skills and steadfast resolve to his unit. His quiet determination and cooperative nature made him an asset to his regiment.

Tragically, Private Howard’s service was cut short on December 20, 1944, at the age of 20. 
During a heavy shell attack on the regiment’s position near the west bank of Fosso Munio, close to the Senio River, James was killed in action. His sacrifice came during one of the campaign’s most intense phases, as Allied forces pushed toward victory in Italy.

James was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, where his grave in Plot III, Row A, Grave 8 stands as a solemn tribute to his courage and sacrifice.

Private James Stanley Howard’s life, though brief, was marked by dedication to his family, his work, and his country. From his humble beginnings on a family farm to his ultimate sacrifice on the battlefield, James embodied the qualities of resilience, service, and selflessness. 
His memory endures as a reminder of the cost of freedom and the bravery of those who fought to secure it.

Letter to Pte Howard from Robert Egge, a Canadian Student visiting the Villanova War Cemetery with his hockey team in April 2009

Dear Sir:

I would like to acknowledge the cost at which you volunteered for the Canadian
Army. You left your mother, father, and your twelve siblings that were your family. You
said goodbye the friends you'd made from school and work, knowing that, while some of
them may have applied with you, there was no way to be sure if you would stay together
during the arduous tasks ahead. You gave up your job at the nickel factory which,
although not being the most exciting, was a steady source of income.
It is hard for me to imagine what you must have felt when you learned that, after
already essentially leaving your life behind, you would also be leaving your country and
travelling halfway across the world to an unknown destination. Thousands of soldiers
would be awaiting your arrival, and each one who would be doing their best to stop you
from reaching your goal. There would be countless challenges each day far greater than
you had ever faced before, many of them life-or-death. lt would've taken an amazing
amount of resiliency on the part of you and your brethren to prevail through this
adversity, despite the noble intent of your efforts.
Thank you for fighting with such amazing bravery and, in the end, paying the
ultimate price for victory. lt is because of the sacrifices by men such as yourself that I
am able to live with the freedoms that I do today. lt is also because of you and your
fellow countrymen that I feel an amazing sense of pride to call myself a Canadian. 
           May you forever rest in peace.

Sincerely,
Robert Eggen
