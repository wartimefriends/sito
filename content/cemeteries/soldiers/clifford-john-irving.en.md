John Irving Clifford was born on September 28, 1925, in Rama, Saskatchewan. The fourth child of Charles James and Sabie Ester Clifford, John grew up in a large and loving family alongside his brothers Gilbert, Donald, and Burford, and his sisters Frances (Boucher), Betty, Janet (Bellhouse), and Ruth. His childhood was shaped by the camaraderie of siblings and the values instilled in him by his hardworking parents.

John attended school until completing one year of high school, after which he worked as a carpenter’s helper. At 5’7” tall and weighing 140 pounds, John was a fair-complexioned young man with blue eyes and light brown hair. Described as neat in appearance, honest, and fundamentally sound, he was noted for his steady demeanor and a love for the outdoors. He enjoyed hunting, fishing, and playing baseball, hobbies that reflected his grounded and active nature.

Motivated by a sense of duty and a desire to contribute to the war effort, John enlisted in the Canadian Army on January 12, 1943, in Timmins, Ontario. Initially placed on the General List at Number 2 District Depot, he expressed a preference for joining the Royal Regiment of Canada. 
However, his service led him to other units, and he was first assigned to the Dufferin and Haldimand Rifles of Canada in November 1943. In May 1944, John joined the Irish Regiment of Canada in Italy, becoming part of the grueling Italian Campaign.

John’s military journey took him from Canada to the United Kingdom in late 1943, where he prepared for overseas deployment. 
By February 1944, he was in Italy, enduring the harsh conditions and intense combat that characterized the campaign. His regiment played a vital role in the Allied push against German forces, facing formidable resistance and difficult terrain.

On the night of January 3–4, 1945, during an advance in the area of Conventello near San Alberto, John was struck by a high-explosive shell. The wound to the right side of his skull proved fatal, and he succumbed to his injuries at the 7th Light Field Ambulance. He was only 19 years old.

Private John Irving Clifford was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, Italy, Plot I, Row A, Grave 7. His grave stands as a solemn reminder of a young life cut short in the pursuit of freedom and peace.

John’s story is one of quiet dedication and sacrifice. From his modest beginnings in Saskatchewan to the battlefields of Italy, he embodied the values of duty, resilience, and selflessness that defined his generation. Though his life was tragically brief, his memory endures in the hearts of his family, his community, and the history of the Irish Regiment of Canada. 
Private John Irving Clifford’s sacrifice serves as a poignant reminder of the cost of war and the enduring legacy of those who gave their lives for a better future.
