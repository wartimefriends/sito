<br>


Harold Edward Eady was born on August 14, 1918, in Renfrew, Ontario, to Robert Henry and Marion Louise Eady. The fourth of nine children, Harold grew up in a farming family with five brothers—Robert Roy Stewart, James Bartle, Duncan Ferguson, William Ralph, and Noble—and three sisters: Marion Agnes, Roberta Jean, and Iris Lavine. Raised in central Ontario, Harold’s early life revolved around farming, family, and a love of motorcycles.

Harold completed Grade 8 and left school at the age of 14 to work on his father’s mixed farm. He gained four years of experience in farming and also spent time working on motorcycles, particularly Norton models, which became a passion of his. Harold had varied employment, including working as a bricklayer’s helper for $21 per week during the summers of 1937 and 1938 and as a miner for five months at the Silvinite Mines in Kirkland Lake, where he earned $45 per week. 
Outside of work, Harold enjoyed motorcycling, boxing, hockey, baseball, hunting, and playing the guitar by ear.

On March 14, 1940, Harold enlisted in the Canadian Army at Petawawa Camp, Ontario, joining the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. Motivated by a sense of duty, Harold quickly displayed his aptitude for military life. 
Described as intelligent, steady, and well-groomed, he advanced through the ranks, earning promotions based on his dedication and ability. He completed a battle drill course in Vernon, BC, and was qualified as a stretcher bearer and first aid instructor.

In April 1943, Harold transferred to the Irish Regiment of Canada at his own request. He was deployed to the United Kingdom on March 23, 1943, and subsequently joined the Italian Campaign in October 1943. 
As part of the regiment, Harold faced the brutal conditions and relentless combat of the Italian theater, where Allied forces worked to liberate the country from German occupation.

Harold’s leadership skills and dedication were recognized throughout his service. Standing 5’6” tall and weighing 140 pounds, he was noted for his soldierly appearance, above-average intelligence, and willingness to take on challenges. His passion for motorcycling even inspired him to express a desire to become a motorcycle mechanic or paratrooper within the military.

On December 12, 1944, during operations near Villanova, Italy, Sergeant Harold Edward Eady was killed in action at the age of 26. His death marked a significant loss for his regiment and family, who deeply mourned his sacrifice.

Harold was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where his grave honors his service and courage. His life, shaped by duty and resilience, stands as a testament to the sacrifices made by those who served during the Second World War.

From his humble beginnings on a farm in Renfrew to the battlefields of Italy, Harold’s journey reflects the determination and selflessness of his generation. Though his life was tragically cut short, the memory of Sergeant Harold Edward Eady lives on in the hearts of his family and in the history of those who gave their lives for freedom and peace.
