Private Colin Andrew Campbell was born on December 17, 1911, in Port Hood, Nova Scotia. The son of Alexander and Margaret Campbell, Colin’s early life was marked by hardship. Orphaned at just 11 years old, he grew up with one surviving brother, John D., and three sisters: Sadie, Mrs. G. MacKinnon, and Josephine Rankin. Another brother, John Duncan, passed away in 1935, and his sister Mary also died young.

Colin completed Grade 7 before entering the workforce, a decision shaped by necessity rather than choice. He worked tirelessly to support himself, holding jobs as a miner, fireman, stoker, and farm laborer. As a first-class miner with Dominion Coal Company in New Waterford, he earned $40–$50 weekly between 1927 and 1939, and later worked as a stoker in the Merchant Navy. Colin’s experiences made him a resilient and resourceful individual, despite the hardships he faced.

Standing 5’6¼” tall and weighing 150 pounds, Colin had a wiry, rugged build with blue eyes, brown hair, and a weathered appearance that reflected his life’s challenges. Known for his strong work ethic and cooperative nature, he also had a wild streak. His restless energy and penchant for heavy drinking often led to disciplinary issues, but he remained steadfast in his dedication to serving in the military.

On June 20, 1941, Colin enlisted in Sydney, Nova Scotia, joining the Cape Breton Highlanders. His decision to enlist was as unorthodox as the man himself—he had been paid off from the Merchant Navy in Halifax, went on a drinking spree, and ended up joining the army. Despite his colorful entry into military life, Colin found a role that suited his rugged determination and resilience.

Colin’s military career began in Canada, where he trained until November 1941 before being deployed to the United Kingdom. Over the next two years, he prepared for the rigors of combat, earning a designation as a Driver Class III in February 1942. Despite his struggles with alcohol and episodes of being AWOL, Colin adapted to the demands of military life, finding a sense of purpose and direction within the Cape Breton Highlanders.

In February 1944, Colin was deployed to Italy, where he joined one of the most grueling campaigns of the Second World War. The Italian Campaign tested every soldier’s mettle, with relentless combat, harsh conditions, and an unforgiving enemy. Colin’s determination and resilience, honed through years of hard labor and personal struggle, carried him through.

Tragically, Colin’s service came to an end on December 23, 1944, when he was killed in action during intense fighting near Villanova, Italy. He was 33 years old.

Private Colin Andrew Campbell was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot III, Row B, Grave 2. His grave is a lasting tribute to a man who, despite his personal challenges, answered his country’s call and gave his life in service.

Colin Campbell’s story is one of complexity—a man shaped by hardship, resilient in spirit, and driven by a sense of duty. His journey from a small-town orphan to a soldier on the front lines exemplifies the courage and sacrifice of those who gave everything for freedom.

Though Colin’s life was far from perfect, his service stands as a reminder that even the most unconventional paths can lead to profound acts of bravery. 
His memory endures in the history of the Cape Breton Highlanders and in the hearts of those who knew him.
