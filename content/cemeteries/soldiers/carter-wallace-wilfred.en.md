Born on December 11, 1922, in Barrie, Ontario, Wallace Wilfred Carter grew up in a large family in the small community of New Lowell. 
The fourth of seven children, Wallace shared his childhood with his five brothers—Frank James, Kenneth Roy, Clifford Wesley, Douglas Keith, and Roger Alexander—and one sister, Audrey Ziegler. Raised on a farm by their parents, Roy Wesley and Della E. Carter, Wallace’s early years were defined by hard work, close family ties, and a love for the outdoors.

Wallace completed Grade 8 before leaving school at 16 to contribute to the family’s livelihood. Working as an outdoor laborer, he helped on his father’s farm and earned additional income cutting wood during the harsh Canadian winters. 
Despite his humble beginnings, Wallace developed a range of hobbies, including fishing, hunting, skating, and playing team sports like hockey and baseball. A musically inclined young man, he enjoyed playing the guitar and harmonica, adding a touch of melody to his life.

As the world plunged into the turmoil of World War II, Wallace enlisted in the Canadian Armed Forces on December 1, 1941, in Toronto, Ontario. 
Motivated by the opportunity to gain new skills and contribute to the war effort, he joined the Royal Canadian Artillery (RCA). 
Standing 5’8” and weighing 155 pounds, Wallace’s healthy and cooperative demeanor made him well-suited for military life. 
His bright personality and fair military knowledge earned him a placement as a gunner, with a suggested focus on signaling and pioneer work.

Wallace’s early service involved extensive training, including a signaling course at Kingston, Ontario. Despite his aspirations of becoming a mechanic, his natural aptitude for communications and artillery solidified his role within the RCA.

Wallace began his overseas deployment on August 23, 1942, serving in the United Kingdom before moving to the Italian theater of operations on October 25, 1943. As part of the Canadian artillery units supporting infantry operations, Wallace played a crucial role in providing firepower and communications amidst the brutal campaigns in Italy.

Throughout his service, Wallace remained a dependable and cooperative soldier, embodying the resilience and dedication that defined his upbringing. The hardships of war mirrored the challenges he faced at home, and he met them with quiet determination.

On December 23, 1944, just 12 days after his 22nd birthday, Gunner Wallace Wilfred Carter was killed in the field near the Senio River in Italy. 
The exact circumstances of his death are unclear; his service records do not explicitly state whether it was due to combat or an accident. Nevertheless, his sacrifice remains a testament to the courage and commitment he brought to his role in the war effort.

Wallace was laid to rest in Villanova Canadian War Cemetery, in Plot III, Row B, Grave 9, where his memory is honored alongside countless others who gave their lives for freedom.

Wallace’s death was one of several tragedies to strike the Carter family during the war. His brother Clifford, serving in the Merchant Marine, was lost at sea on November 5, 1940, while another brother, Kenneth, served overseas in the Canadian Army. Douglas Keith Carter also contributed to the war effort, stationed in Brampton, Ontario. 
Despite these profound losses, the Carter family exemplified the unwavering spirit of dedication and sacrifice that so many Canadian families shared during the war.
