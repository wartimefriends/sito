#### Irish Regiment of Canada, R.C.I.C
<br>


George Stanley LATIMER, a member of the Irish Regiment of Canada, was a young man who gave his life in service during World War II. Born on August 25, 1925, in Georgetown, Ontario, George grew up in a close-knit family with his father, Donald, his mother, Tryphosa, who passed away in October 1939, and his siblings—brothers Ronald and Douglas, and sister Joan. 
His early years were shaped by the challenges of the Great Depression, which placed financial strain on the family and limited George’s educational opportunities.

George attended school in Georgetown, completing Grade 8 and part of Grade 9 before leaving at the age of 15 to help support his family. He found work locally, first at a porcelain clay press in Georgetown, then molding fire bricks, and finally at Acton Tannery, where he spent a year and a half brushing leather. His jobs were physically demanding but helped him develop a strong work ethic and practical skills.

On April 14, 1942, George enlisted in the Canadian Army in Brampton, Ontario, at the age of 16, motivated by a sense of duty and commitment to his country. He initially joined the #6 Defence and Employment Platoon of The Lorne Scots (Peel, Dufferin, and Halton Regiment), a local unit. Although George expressed interest in remaining with the Lorne Scots as a rifleman, he also had an aptitude for repairing his own guns and hoped to someday work as an armourer if an opening arose within his regiment. However, his desire to stay within his unit outweighed any interest in transferring for specialized training.

George’s service took him across Canada for various postings, from Brampton to Niagara and then to British Columbia, where he trained as a rifleman. He was recognized as a good soldier with average intelligence, stability, and dedication, though his quiet, mild personality made him less suited for leadership roles. In June 1943, George embarked for the United Kingdom, where he continued his training and was transferred to the Irish Regiment of Canada. 
His journey would eventually lead him to the Italian front as part of the Allied advance.

Deployed to Italy in October 1943, George faced some of the most intense combat of the Italian Campaign. In Italy, the challenges were formidable, with difficult terrain, adverse weather, and fierce opposition from enemy forces. George endured the hardship alongside his comrades, contributing to the efforts with quiet resilience.

Away from the front lines, George had simple interests. A reserved young man, he found satisfaction in hands-on work, such as maintaining and repairing equipment, and took pride in his growing skills. He showed loyalty to his regiment and preferred to remain in his familiar unit rather than seek new opportunities elsewhere.

Tragically, Private George Stanley Latimer was killed in action on December 20, 1944, at the age of 19. 
His sacrifice is commemorated at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot III, Row A, Grave 10. 
For his family and hometown, the loss of George was profound—a young man who had given his all to support his family, his community, and his country.

George Latimer’s legacy endures as a testament to the quiet courage and selflessness of young soldiers who left behind the familiar in the hopes of a better world. His story stands as a reminder of the many sacrifices made by those who, like George, served with dignity and honor.
