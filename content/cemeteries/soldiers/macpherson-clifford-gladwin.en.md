Clifford Gladwin MacPHERSON was born on June 27, 1911, in Musquodoboit, Halifax County, Nova Scotia. Growing up in a hardworking family. 
Clifford was one of several siblings, including two brothers who, like him, would serve in the military. His father, John McLean, was a coal miner in Pictou County, a demanding occupation that influenced Clifford’s own career path. Clifford left school after completing Grade 7 to help support his family, working for many years as a coal miner and later as a shovel operator on the Alaskan Highway, making an average wage of $35 a week. 
Known for his modesty, maturity, and stable character, Clifford had a mechanical aptitude and was skilled in driving both cars and trucks.

Clifford’s early connection to military life began with the militia, where he briefly served with the Pictou Highlanders in 1939. 
However, his initial enlistment was cut short when he was discharged due to a medical issue—diabetes, which, though it initially disqualified him, did not prevent him from later rejoining the military. In 1943, at age 31, Clifford enlisted once more, driven by a sense of duty to serve. This time, he joined the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps, hoping to make a meaningful contribution to the war effort.

Clifford trained across various locations in Canada before being deployed to the United Kingdom in September 1943, then to Italy in January 1944. His service in Italy was marked by intense combat as Allied forces pushed to liberate the region from enemy control. On September 1, 1944, Clifford was wounded in battle and hospitalized for nearly a month, recovering at a Canadian General Hospital. Despite this setback, he returned to his unit, demonstrating his resilience and commitment to his fellow soldiers.

In his personal life, Clifford was known for his love of sports, particularly skating, as well as movies and reading. These simple pleasures provided him with moments of comfort amid the challenges of military life. Standing at 5’10” and weighing 165 pounds, with brown eyes and a solid build, he was well-suited to the physical demands of his role. 
Clifford was described as possessing high native ability, exceptional mechanical skills, and a good physical appearance. He adapted well to military life and took pride in his role within the Army, finding a sense of fulfillment and purpose in his service.

Tragically, Clifford’s journey came to an end on December 15, 1944, when he was killed in action in Italy at the age of 33. 
His passing left a void in his family, who mourned the loss of a son, brother, and soldier who had given everything for his country. Clifford was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, a place where his memory is honored among fellow soldiers who shared his journey and his sacrifice.

Clifford Gladwin MacPherson’s story is one of resilience and dedication. From a young miner in Nova Scotia to a soldier fighting in Italy, he exemplified the spirit of service and courage. 
His legacy lives on, a reminder of the strength and commitment of those who served, giving everything in pursuit of a better world.
