Born on September 18, 1919, in Salmon Arm, British Columbia, George Benjamin Boutwell grew up in a close-knit yet tumultuous family. The fourth of five children, George’s early life was marked by loss and resilience. 
His mother, Gertrude Florence Buchan, passed away when George was just 18 months old, leaving his father, George Leslie Boutwell, to raise the family. 
At the age of 12, George gained a stepmother when his father remarried, providing some stability in a childhood shaped by hardship.

George’s early years revolved around the rural life of Salmon Arm. He worked on his father’s farm during the summer seasons and labored in the bush during the winters, gaining experience in farming and forestry. 
By the time he was 18, he was driving trucks for his father, earning $25 a week—a respectable wage for the time. His practical skills and work ethic reflected the industrious spirit of his upbringing, as he balanced farming, bush work, and truck driving to support himself and his family.

Despite having only a Grade 7 education, George demonstrated superior learning ability and a desire to expand his skill set. His interest in mechanics led him to express a strong desire for training as a motor mechanic or military transport driver—a role for which his practical experience made him highly suited. 
In his free time, George enjoyed hobbies such as building model aircraft and sports like hunting, fishing, and golf, which showcased his curiosity and appreciation for the outdoors.

George enlisted in the Canadian military on July 19, 1940, in Salmon Arm, BC, joining alongside friends in the Rocky Mountain Rangers. His enlistment reflected a combination of camaraderie and a sense of duty during a time when the world was at war. After two years of service in Canada, he was deployed to the United Kingdom in September 1942, where he continued his training and prepared for active combat.

In March 1944, George was transferred to the Westminster Regiment (Motors), a unit within the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps. By November 1943, he was deployed to Italy, joining the grueling Italian Campaign. 
The campaign was notorious for its harsh conditions, with soldiers battling not only enemy forces but also difficult terrain and severe weather. George’s unit, known for its mechanized capabilities, played a critical role in providing mobility and logistical support on the battlefield.

Throughout his service, George’s cooperative disposition, satisfactory military knowledge, and practical skills made him a dependable soldier. However, his military career was not without its personal struggles. 
Shortly before going overseas, George briefly went AWOL to meet his infant daughter, Charlotte Irene, born just six weeks earlier. This fleeting moment with his daughter would be his only chance to see her.

On December 14, 1944, George was killed in action at the age of 25, leaving behind his wife, Mary, and their young daughter, Charlotte, who was only 2½ years old at the time. 
George’s brother, Edgar, also served overseas with the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada and survived the war, but the family was left to mourn the loss of a devoted husband, father, and brother.

George’s legacy lives on through his daughter, Charlotte, who has worked to reconnect with her Boutwell relatives and preserve the memory of her father. Though George was a father for only a short time, his love for his family was evident in the sacrifices he made and the life he lived. 
After his passing, George’s best friend from overseas returned his writing kit to Mary, and in a poignant twist of fate, Mary later married this friend, ensuring that a connection to George’s memory remained a part of Charlotte’s life.

Corporal George Benjamin Boutwell’s story is one of resilience, service, and sacrifice. 
From his humble beginnings in Salmon Arm to his role in one of history’s most significant conflicts, George exemplified the qualities of duty, determination, and love. His name is etched in the annals of history, a reminder of the countless young lives lost in the pursuit of a better future. 
Today, he rests in Italy, far from the family farm he left behind, but his legacy endures in the memories of those who honor his service.
