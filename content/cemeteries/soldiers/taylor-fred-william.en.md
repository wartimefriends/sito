Born on April 26, 1919, in St. Thomas, Ontario, Fred William Taylor grew up in a close-knit family. He was the son of Fred Borman and Harriet Ann Taylor and had two brothers, Frank Edgar and John Lauchlin. Frank was a policeman, John was an Airman and Fred joined the Army. His family had also endured the loss of his sister, Muriel Irene, who passed away in 1921. At the time of his enlistment, Fred was living in Watford, Ontario, and working as a laborer for a chicken buyer. His ambition was to become a traffic officer.

Fred married Donna Evelyn Taylor (née Eastabrook), and the two began building a life together. Their marriage was a source of strength for Fred, as he faced the challenges of war.

Taylor enlisted in the Canadian Army on August 23, 1941, in London, Ontario. After completing his basic training, he was posted to No. 1 District Depot with the Provost Reinforcement Unit. In September 1943, he was transferred to the Perth Regiment, a unit within the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps. His service took him first to the United Kingdom, where he was stationed from August 26 to October 26, 1943. Soon after, he was deployed to Italy, where he would serve for the remainder of his military career.

Standing at 5’10 ¾” and weighing 152 pounds, Taylor was noted for his dark brown hair, hazel eyes, and dark complexion. He was a dedicated soldier, and his leadership abilities earned him the rank of Sergeant in Company C of the Perth Regiment.

On December 20, 1944, during the Italian Campaign, Sergeant Fred William Taylor was killed in action at the Munio River crossing. The exact circumstances of his death were communicated to the Department of National Defence in a letter from his wife, Donna, who inquired about the care of Canadian war cemeteries in Italy after reading an article in the Free Press in London, Ontario, on May 2, 1946.

Fred William Taylor’s sacrifice was deeply felt by his family. His wife Donna eventually remarried, becoming Mrs. McInnes, and moved to Windsor, Ontario. Sergeant Taylor, who had served his country with honor and courage, is buried at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, Plot IV, Row C, Grave 3. 
His legacy endures through the memories of his loved ones and the gratitude of the nation he gave his life to protect.
