Peter KOWALCHUK was a young man who joined the army with a spirit of adventure, a strong work ethic, and a desire to see the world.

Born on July 28, 1920, in Teulon, Manitoba, Peter was the fourth child of Marko (Mike) and Isabella Kowalchuk, immigrants from Ukraine who settled in Manitoba’s Interlake region. Alongside his siblings—brothers Nick and Paul, and sisters Nettie, Mary, and Gene—Peter grew up on the family’s 60-acre farm, where his parents worked tirelessly to make a living on government-granted land.

Peter’s early life was filled with the demands of farm life, where he developed a love for baseball and hockey, and he often entertained his family by playing the mouth organ. He attended a small rural school in Teulon, completing up to Grade 6, before leaving school to work locally as jobs were scarce. Known for his cheerful and cooperative disposition, Peter was strong and well-built, standing at 5 feet 8 ½ inches tall and weighing 170 pounds. He enjoyed the outdoors and dreamed of continuing as a truck driver or farmer after the war.

Peter enlisted in the Canadian Army on March 5, 1940, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
At just 19, he was eager to follow in the footsteps of his older brother, Nick, who had also enlisted and was later wounded in France. Though his parents were hesitant to see him go, Peter was determined. He joined with other young men from his area, looking forward to new experiences and hoping to learn a trade in the military. Peter initially trained as part of the motor corps, reflecting his interest in driving, but soon switched to the infantry upon arrival in Europe.

Peter’s military journey began with basic training in Canada, followed by a deployment to the United Kingdom in April 1940. For over four years, he trained and served in the U.K., preparing for the challenges of frontline combat. In September 1944, he was deployed to Italy as part of the Italian Campaign, joining the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment in December. His service in Italy was marked by courage, particularly during the engagements at Gòdo and San Pancrazio, where his regiment’s actions in capturing these towns were considered exceptional.

At the end of December 1944, Peter’s regiment moved to positions along the Senio River, where they conducted patrol work. It was here that Peter faced the harsh realities of warfare. 
On December 31, 1944, at the age of 24, Private Peter Kowalchuk was killed in action, bringing an untimely end to a life filled with promise, warmth, and a spirit of adventure. 
His family, friends, and community in Teulon mourned his loss deeply, remembering him as a kind-hearted, mischievous, and handsome young man. His sister, Nettie, spoke fondly of Peter’s gentle and loving nature, qualities that made him beloved by all who knew him.

Today, Private Peter Kowalchuk rests at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot II, Row C, Grave 10. His memory endures, preserved by the stories and recollections of his family, especially those shared by his nephew, Gerry Kaban, who wished he had known his courageous uncle. 
Peter’s life and sacrifice stand as a testament to the courage of young men who left their homes to serve, seeking adventure and purpose, and ultimately giving their lives in the pursuit of peace and freedom. His legacy remains a tribute to the resilience, kindness, and bravery that defined him.
