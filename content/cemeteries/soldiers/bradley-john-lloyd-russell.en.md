<br>


Born on September 9, 1924, in Ottawa, Ontario, John was the eldest of four children in a loving family. His parents, William John and Margaret Lillian Bradley, raised John alongside his three younger sisters: Lillian Alethea, Maureen Ruth, and Beverley Ann. A caring and responsible older brother, John set an example for his siblings through his quiet determination and dedication.

John attended Ottawa Technical School, where he pursued an industrial course. Though not a particularly strong student, he enjoyed school and repeated Grades 3 and 4 before leaving after Grade 9 to enlist. 
During his school years, he developed an interest in automotive work and gained some driving experience, skills he hoped to expand upon in the military. During the summers, he worked at Bruce’s Dairy in Ottawa, assisting in the ice cream department, earning a reputation for his reliability and good nature.

Standing 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 124 pounds, John was a slim and youthful young man with a fair complexion, hazel eyes, and light brown hair. Despite his slight build, he was active in sports, participating in hockey (as a defenseman), baseball, basketball, volleyball, and swimming. He enjoyed outdoor activities such as hunting and fishing and spent two years in the Wolf Cubs, further developing his teamwork and sense of responsibility. A stamp collector in his spare time, John’s hobbies reflected his inquisitive and engaged personality.

On June 2, 1943, at just 18 years old, John enlisted in the Canadian Army in Kingston, Ontario. 
Motivated by a desire to serve his country, he left school and began his military training with No. 3-A District Depot. His instructors noted his keen interest in the Army and his enthusiasm for learning, particularly during his Motor Transport (M.T.) course. Though young and not naturally aggressive, John’s good attitude and willingness to train made him a promising infantryman.

John’s military journey began in Canada, where he trained from June 1943 to April 1944. He was then deployed to the United Kingdom before joining the Italian Campaign in May 1944. The campaign was one of the most grueling theaters of the Second World War, demanding endurance, courage, and resilience from all who served. Despite his youth, John proved himself capable and dedicated, fulfilling his role with quiet determination.

Tragically, on December 28, 1944, John was killed in action during combat close to the Senio River, Italy. He was just 18 years old. 
His loss was a devastating blow to his family and comrades, who admired his perseverance and potential.

Private John Lloyd Russell Bradley was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot V, Row A, Grave 6. His grave stands as a solemn tribute to a young man who gave his life for the ideals of freedom and peace.

John’s story is one of youthful determination and sacrifice. From the classrooms of Ottawa to the battlefields of Italy, he embodied the courage and commitment of his generation. Though his life was tragically brief, his legacy endures in the hearts of his family, his community, and the history of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. 
His sacrifice reminds us of the profound cost of war and the enduring gratitude owed to those who gave everything for a better future.
