Archibald Reginald Kierstead was born on August 6, 1911, in Campbellton, New Brunswick. 
Standing Tall at 6’1” and weighing 188 pounds, Archie, as he was known, was a striking figure with his medium complexion, blue eyes, and brown hair. Raised in a Roman Catholic family, he was the second son of David Alexander and Mary Elizabeth Kierstead, with two brothers, Ralph and Ian. Growing up in Niagara Falls, Ontario, he developed a strong work ethic and a resilient character, both of which would guide him throughout his life.

With a Grade 8 education, Archie began working as a truck driver and milk salesman, a role he held for five years. Later, he worked as a truck driver for National Grocery Ltd. in Niagara, earning $20 a week. His job brought him satisfaction, and he looked forward to returning to it after his service. Despite his busy work life, Archie found time to pursue sports, particularly enjoying softball as a catcher and hockey as a goalie, sports that required quick reflexes and a strong, steady presence—traits he would carry into his military career.

Archie’s sense of duty led him to enlist in the Canadian Army on November 15, 1941, in Toronto, Ontario, where he joined the 5th Armored Regiment, the 8th Princess Louise’s (New Brunswick) Hussars, part of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. He aspired to serve as a driver or mechanic and trained rigorously to meet these goals. Described as neat, lean, cheerful, and stable, Archie brought both resilience and optimism to his duties. Though he had undergone an appendectomy six years prior, he was otherwise in good health and ready to serve.

After completing initial training in Canada, Archie was deployed to the United Kingdom on May 3, 1942, where he continued his service for over a year. In November 1943, he was sent to Italy as part of the grueling Italian Campaign, known for its challenging terrain and intense combat. Archie faced physical challenges during his service, including a hospital stay from February 24 to March 10, 1943, to treat a tendon tumor, which he recovered from. 
Unfortunately, in September 1944, he was wounded in action and admitted to the 1st Canadian General Hospital on September 13 before being transferred to the 2nd British General Hospital two days later.

Though he returned to active duty, Archie’s journey was tragically cut short on January 4, 1945, when he died of wounds sustained in Italy. 
He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, where his grave in Plot I, Row B, Grave 5 stands as a testament to his courage and dedication.

Throughout his life, Archie’s commitment to his family, work, and duty was unwavering. Known for his cheerfulness, stability, and loyalty, he remains a remembered figure of integrity and bravery in both his family and military community.
