+++

He was the son of John James Nash and Annie Fell. Tragically, his father passed away when John was just two years old. Throughout his early life, he believed his name to be James Albert Nash, a name he used upon enlistment. It wasn’t until April 30, 1943, that he confirmed his true name as John James Nash.

In 1918, at the age of 12, John immigrated to Canada, possibly as part of the British Home Children program, which relocated disadvantaged children to Canada for better opportunities. Having completed primary school in England, he began working as a farm laborer in the Campbellford, Ontario area from 1921 to 1932. He then worked in a quarry in Marmora, Ontario, operated by his uncle, from 1932 to 1934. Between 1935 and 1939, he was employed as a highway construction laborer in Marmora.

On December 4, 1927, John married Mary Lena Wells in Campbellford, Ontario. The couple settled in Marmora and had two daughters: Joan Gertrude and Jean Rosalie, who were eight and two years old, respectively, at the outbreak of World War II. 
A devoted family man, John’s hobbies included fishing, which he enjoyed in the serene landscapes of Ontario.

With the onset of World War II, John felt a strong sense of duty to serve his adopted country. On September 11, 1939, just days after Canada declared war on Germany, he enlisted in the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment in Madoc, Ontario. At the time of his enlistment, he stood 5 feet 6 inches tall, with fair hair and blue eyes.

Private Nash embarked from Halifax with his regiment on December 19, 1939, arriving in Greenwich, England, on January 1, 1940. His early days in England were marked by intensive training and preparation. In June 1940, he was part of the abortive expedition to Brest, France, intended to support Allied forces during the Battle of France. However, the rapid advance of German forces led to the mission’s cancellation.

Initially serving as a rifleman, John transitioned to the role of stretcher bearer in April 1941 after completing specialized first aid and medical courses. His compassion and dedication made him well-suited for this critical role, responsible for providing frontline medical assistance and evacuating the wounded.

On June 13, 1943, Private Nash and his regiment departed England, arriving in Sicily on July 10 as part of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. The campaign was characterized by fierce fighting in challenging terrain.

On July 22, 1943, during the famous night advance and dawn attack on the hill town of Assoro, Private Nash and Private A. Adams were tasked with drawing water for the wounded from a single, exposed well. Unexpectedly, they were confronted by a German patrol. In the chaos, Nash was taken prisoner, beginning a harrowing journey as a prisoner of war.

While imprisoned in Italy at Campo Concentramento P.G. 66, John managed to send two letters to his wife, Mary Lena. In his letters dated August 3 and August 19, 1943, he reassured her of his well-being and urged her not to worry. He spoke of the decent treatment he was receiving, the importance of Red Cross parcels, and his hopes of returning home soon. He also mentioned suffering from impetigo, a skin infection, due to limited medical supplies and personal hygiene items like soap, a toothbrush, and a razor.

Excerpt from his letter dated August 3, 1943:

*“My Darling Wife & Family,

I am at present a P.O.W. in Italy but my dear I am very well and being looked after very well also we receive one Red Cross parcel a week which I can tell you is very nice… Now please keep smiling, and love and kisses to you all.

As ever, Your lovingly,

Jim”*

As the war progressed, John was transferred to Germany. 
On October 29, 1943, he tragically died of pneumonia in the Lazarette (military hospital) of Spittal Stalag XVIII-A Zweiglager, a prisoner-of-war camp located in Spittal an der Drau, Austria, near the Italian border. He was 37 years old.

Captain Ian B. McIver of the New Zealand Armed Forces wrote to Mary Lena Nash on November 2, 1943, conveying the sad news:

“It is my sad duty to write you relative to the passing away of your husband on the twenty-ninth of October last. He had been confined to bed, shortly after his transfer from Italy with influenza which developed into pneumonia and was ultimately the cause of his death… It fell to my lot to perform the last rites at his burial which took place in the prisoner of war section of the local cemetery and was attended by representatives of the Allied Forces.”

Initially, Private Nash was buried in the prisoner-of-war section of Edling Cemetery in Spittal an der Drau. 
In 1946, his remains were re-interred at the Klagenfurt War Cemetery in Austria. Then, in 1950, following a policy to relocate Canadian war dead from German soil, he was laid to rest at the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, Plot 7, Row C, Grave 5.

For his service and sacrifice, Private Nash was posthumously awarded the 1939-45 Star, the Italy Star, the Defence Medal, the War Medal, and the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal with Clasp. His widow, Mary Lena Nash, received his medals and the Memorial Cross in Marmora, Ontario.

In 1997, Gerald Belanger of Marmora undertook research to honor Private Nash by creating a profile for each veteran represented at the Sacred Heart of Jesus Cemetery in Marmora, ensuring that his memory and the memories of others who served are preserved for future generations.

Remembered for his courage and dedication, Private John James Nash’s story is a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by so many during World War II. His journey from England to Canada, and ultimately to the battlefields of Europe, reflects the profound commitment of individuals who fought for freedom and peace. His legacy lives on through his family and the enduring gratitude of a nation he proudly served.
