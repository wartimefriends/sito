Born on June 7, 1923, at the Ottawa Civic Hospital, Fred was the first child of George and Mary Hutton. He grew up alongside his younger siblings, Jean and John, as the family moved to Toronto in 1930.

Fred’s childhood was filled with the hallmarks of a Canadian boyhood. Living across from a park, he spent winters skating, playing hockey, tobogganing, and bobsledding. Summers were marked by swims in the Don River or braving the icy waters of Lake Ontario after long walks to the beach. Like many of his peers, Fred worked hard to earn pocket money, delivering fruit and vegetables on his bicycle every Saturday from morning until night.

Fred attended Earl Haig Public School and then Danforth Tech Secondary School. An average student, he approached his studies reluctantly but shone in woodworking and practical activities. He excelled at building model airplanes and had a keen interest in cars, often tinkering with engines. After leaving school, Fred found work at Marrs Motors as a shipping and stock clerk, where he hoped to pursue his passion for mechanics.

The outbreak of World War II changed everything. 
In November 1942, Fred enlisted in the Canadian Army. Standing 5’11” and weighing 130 pounds, Fred was described as intelligent, likable, and full of potential. He began his military training in and around Toronto before being transferred to Valcartier Camp in Quebec in February 1943.

On May 14, 1943, Fred was deployed to the United Kingdom, where he continued his training in preparation for active combat. By October 26, 1943, he was transferred to Italy, joining the grueling Italian Campaign. 
It was in Italy, surrounded by challenging conditions and relentless fighting, that Fred forged a strong bond with a fellow soldier, Maurice Tavignot, a casual acquaintance from Toronto who became a close friend amidst the chaos of war.

Tragically, Fred’s service came to an end on January 2, 1945. As he and Maurice traveled along a dirt road under heavy bombardment, their jeep was struck by a direct hit. Both men died before reaching the field hospital.
Frederick Hootun’s life was cut short at the age of 21.

Fred’s sacrifice, like that of so many young soldiers, exemplifies the courage and commitment of a generation called to defend freedom. He is remembered not just as a soldier but as a son, brother, and friend whose life was filled with quiet joys, aspirations, and a dedication to service.

Though gone, Fred George Hootun remains a lasting part of the story of Canada’s contribution to the Second World War—a young man whose sacrifice ensured a brighter future for those who followed. 
He is, and will always be, gone but not forgotten.
