<br>


Private Andrew Clulow was born on June 25, 1911, in Galt, Ontario, into a large, close-knit family. He was the seventh of eight children born to James and Alice Clulow, who passed away before his enlistment. Andrew grew up alongside his brother William and six sisters—Mrs. Henry Coltman, Mrs. Roy Shoemaker, Mrs. Jim Clark, Mrs. Garf McQuinin, Alice, and Mrs. Wilma Last.

Andrew completed Grade 6 before entering the workforce to support himself and his family. His early years were marked by hard work and resilience, with jobs in construction, general labor, and as a crane operator at a steel factory and sheet metal warehouse in Galt. From 1936 to 1942, he earned $25 per week, supplemented by seasonal work unloading coal during winters. 
Despite his limited formal education, Andrew developed practical skills and a strong work ethic.

Andrew married Grace Clulow, and together they had two daughters, Audrey Jean and Sheila Grace. His home life was described as normal and stable, with Grace showing a reasonable attitude toward his military service. 
Standing 5’4” tall and weighing 140 pounds, Andrew had blue eyes, brown hair, and a fair complexion. Quiet and reserved, he was cooperative but self-conscious and disliked large crowds. Though not assertive, Andrew was a mature, robust man who approached his responsibilities with diligence.

Driven by the lack of steady work, Andrew enlisted in the Canadian Army on February 4, 1942, in London, Ontario. Initially assigned to the Perth Regiment, he trained as an infantryman and later transitioned to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. His military journey began in Canada before he was deployed to the United Kingdom in July 1942.
During his time in the UK, Andrew prepared for the challenges of war, balancing his quiet disposition with the demands of military life. 
In November 1944, he joined the Italian Campaign, one of the most grueling theaters of the Second World War. 
As part of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, Andrew served in intense combat conditions that tested both physical and mental endurance.

Tragically, Andrew’s service was cut short on January 2, 1945, when he was killed in action at Masiera close to the Senio River, Italy. He was 33 years old. 
His death was a profound loss to his family, who had awaited his return, and to his regiment, which valued his steady and cooperative nature.

Private Andrew Clulow was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot II, Row A, Grave 3. His grave is a lasting tribute to his service and sacrifice.

Andrew’s story is one of quiet strength and perseverance. From his modest beginnings in Galt to the battlefields of Italy, he exemplified the values of duty and commitment that defined his generation. Though he was described as reserved and unassuming, his actions on the battlefield spoke of courage and dedication.

His memory endures in the hearts of his family and in the history of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. 
Andrew’s sacrifice reminds us of the countless lives given in the pursuit of freedom and peace, and of the enduring legacy of those who served with honor.
