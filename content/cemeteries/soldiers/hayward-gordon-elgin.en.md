title = "Trooper Gordon Elgin HAYWARD"
+++


Gordon Elgin Hayward was a man of quiet determination, intelligence, and loyalty. Born on June 28, 1915, in Eastnor Township, Ontario, Gordon was the fifth of six children in the Hayward family. His parents, George Edgar and Dorothy Matilda, raised him alongside his siblings: Oscar, Donald, Lloyd, Della May, and Dorothy Grace. Growing up in rural Ontario during challenging economic times, Gordon left school after completing grade nine at age 13 to help support his family, as his father was unable to work.

Gordon’s early life reflected his resourcefulness and work ethic. He worked as a clerk, later owning and operating a general store in Pike Bay, Ontario, for five years. For a time, he also worked in the automotive industry as an assembly worker at Ford in Detroit, Michigan. Despite limited formal education, Gordon demonstrated keen intelligence, solid character, and leadership potential. His natural musical talent, shown through his piano and organ playing, complemented his practical skills and resourcefulness.

When Gordon received a call to duty under the National Resources Mobilization Act (NRMA), he decided to enlist for active service on August 10, 1942, in London, Ontario. Standing 5’7½” tall and weighing 171 pounds, with blue eyes and a strong build, Gordon impressed his superiors during basic training at Kitchener, Ontario, and advanced training at Camp Borden. Though he initially served in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps (R.C.A.M.C.) as a storeman, Gordon’s desire for more active combat roles became evident. He sought a transfer to the Canadian Armoured Corps (C.A.C.), where he believed his temperament and skills would be better suited.

By June 1943, Gordon had joined the Governor General’s Horse Guards, a reconnaissance regiment renowned for its daring operations. 
His intelligence, determination, and aptitude for wireless training made him a valuable asset, though his superiors noted that he sometimes struggled with initiative and self-motivation. Despite being earmarked for officer training, his lack of formal education prevented him from advancing. Nonetheless, Gordon’s potential and dedication were recognized, and he was deployed overseas.

After serving in Canada and the United Kingdom, Gordon arrived in Italy in November 1943, joining the grueling Italian Campaign. 
As part of the 3rd Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, he played a critical role in the regiment’s operations, which involved navigating harsh terrain, gathering intelligence, and engaging in combat under challenging conditions.

Tragically, on December 24, 1944, Trooper Gordon Elgin Hayward was killed in action at the age of 28. His sacrifice came just one day before Christmas, marking a somber end to a life of service and promise. 
He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he lies in plot IV C 10. His grave is a lasting tribute to his courage, intelligence, and devotion to his country.

Gordon’s story is one of quiet heroism. A man who left the comfort of home to serve, he brought his skills, intelligence, and determination to the battlefield. Though his life was cut short, his legacy endures, a reminder of the sacrifices made by so many in the pursuit of freedom.
