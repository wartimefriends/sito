Edwin Wade PARKER was born on March 22, 1914, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The only child of Edwin Godfrey and Mabel Louise Parker, Edwin enjoyed a happy childhood in a supportive family. His father managed the Winnipeg Auditorium, a position that likely influenced Edwin’s early exposure to community and cultural events.

Edwin completed his education at Kelvin High School in Winnipeg, achieving matriculation after completing grade XI. After leaving school in 1931, he began his professional career as a junior clerk at the Winnipeg Auditorium. Demonstrating diligence and competence, he advanced to become the paymaster-accountant and office manager for the City of Winnipeg Health Department. Over 12 years of service, he earned a respectable salary of $40 per week, reflecting his reliability and the trust placed in him by his employers.

In September 1939, Edwin married Evelyn Scott, marking the beginning of a joyful chapter in his personal life. Although the couple had no children, their marriage was filled with mutual support and shared interests. Edwin was an active sportsman who excelled in tennis—his favorite sport—and also enjoyed playing softball and swimming. A fair distance swimmer, he was known for his athleticism and love of the outdoors. Additionally, he had a talent for entertainment, particularly playing percussion drums, and had an interest in scroll printing, showcasing his artistic side.

Edwin’s leadership qualities were evident in his community involvement. He served as the president of the Granite Tennis Club for two years, highlighting his ability to lead and organize. He was also an active member of the Order of DeMolay, a youth leadership organization, where he held office and participated in the degree team. Described as a quiet individual with inner aggressiveness, he possessed natural leadership abilities and a strong sense of responsibility.

His military career began with the 10th District Royal Canadian Corps of Signals (R.C.C.S.), where he served in the reserves from August 9, 1940, to August 20, 1943. During this time, he qualified as a Sergeant and gained above-average military training for a reservist. Despite his qualifications, Edwin modestly chose to serve as a rifleman in the infantry, hoping to earn promotion overseas through merit and dedication.

On August 21, 1943, driven by patriotism, Edwin voluntarily enlisted in the active forces in Winnipeg. He was not subject to conscription but felt a personal duty to serve his country during World War II. Initially considered for officer training due to his leadership skills and military experience, circumstances prevented him from pursuing the Officer Cadet Training Unit (O.C.T.U.). His preference was to serve directly in the infantry, where he believed he could make the most immediate impact.

In May 1944, Edwin was taken on strength by the Perth Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps (R.C.I.C.). He expressed a desire to remain with his friend, J.W. Weston, who was in the same company, underscoring the camaraderie and strong bonds formed within military ranks. His superiors noted his potential as non-commissioned officer material and recognized his suitability for roles such as a clerk (pay) or orderly room duties, given his extensive civilian experience in administration and finance.

Edwin’s overseas service began on April 5, 1944, when he was deployed to the United Kingdom. Less than a month later, on May 4, 1944, he arrived in Italy to join the Italian Campaign—a series of pivotal Allied operations aimed at liberating Italy from Axis forces. His dedication and competence were evident throughout his service, earning the respect of his peers and superiors alike.

Tragically, Private Edwin Wade Parker was killed in action on December 20, 1944, at the age of 30. His death was a profound loss to his family, particularly his wife Evelyn, and to his unit, where his leadership and commitment had made a significant impact. 
He was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, his grave located at Plot IV, Row B, Grave 6—a solemn reminder of the sacrifices made by so many during the war.

Remembered for his quiet strength, leadership, and unwavering commitment, Private Parker embodied the selfless service of countless individuals who left their civilian lives to fight for freedom during World War II. His story is a poignant testament to the courage and dedication of those who served, and his legacy continues to be honored by all who remember the cost of peace.
