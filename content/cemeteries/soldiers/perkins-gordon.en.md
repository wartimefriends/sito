Gordon PERKINS was born on November 7, 1920, in the small town of Danville, located in the Province of Quebec, Canada. 
Raised in a close-knit family, he was the son of Herbert and Clara Perkins. Gordon had a brother named Stuart and two sisters, Glenrose and Irene, the latter of whom resided in Quebec City after marrying into the Johnston family.

Growing up, Gordon was known for his cheerful disposition and mental alertness. He stood at 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed 172 pounds—a husky build that made him well-suited for heavy training and work. An active youth, he participated in various sports, including baseball, football, and softball, showcasing his athleticism and team spirit.

Gordon completed the 11th grade at an urban school in Quebec, demonstrating a commitment to his education. Shortly after finishing school, he decided to serve his country by enlisting in the military. On September 25, 1941, at the age of 20, he enlisted in Quebec, bringing with him skills as a motor vehicle mechanic—a trade that would prove valuable in the army.

His initial military service began in Canada, where he served from September 25, 1941, to March 12, 1942. During this time, he was employed in administrative duties at the No. 1 Canadian Base Ordnance Workshop (C.B.O.W.). Recognizing his capabilities, the army sent him overseas to the United Kingdom on March 13, 1942. There, he continued his service until September 28, 1944, contributing to the war effort during a critical period in World War II.

In October 1944, Gordon transferred from the Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (RCEME) to the Canadian Infantry Corps (CIC), reflecting a shift from technical support to frontline service. Shortly thereafter, on December 5, 1944, he was transferred to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (4PLDG), a regiment of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps.

Gordon arrived in Italy on September 29, 1944, joining the Italian Campaign—a series of Allied military operations aimed at removing Axis forces from Italy. Tragically, just a few months later, on December 15, 1944, Private Gordon Perkins was killed in action at the age of 26. His sacrifice was a profound loss to his family, especially his elderly father, Herbert, who was dependent on him.

He was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, a testament to his service and the ultimate sacrifice he made for his country. His grave is located at Plot VI, Row C, Grave 2. 
Gordon’s commitment to duty and his contributions to the war effort remain a proud part of his family’s legacy and Canadian history.

Remembered for his bravery and dedication, Private Gordon Perkins exemplified the courage of those who fought in World War II. His story serves as a poignant reminder of the countless individuals who left their homes and families to stand against tyranny, many of whom, like Gordon, did not return.
