<br>


Henry Coulter SCOTT, known for his quiet determination and sense of duty, was born on February 16, 1922, in the small community of Wallace Bridge, Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. Henry was one of the children of George H. Scott and Dolina Scott, though his mother passed away when he was young. Growing up, he shared his life with his brothers, Cpl. William G. and Herbert A., and his sisters Dolina M., Isabel, and Elsie. Additionally, he had a half-sister, Ellen, who would later marry and become Mrs. Opray. The Scotts were a hardworking family, bound by strong roots and the Presbyterian faith.

After completing eighth grade, Henry went to work as a sawmill laborer. Known as a dependable and honest man, Henry was drawn to the outdoors, enjoying sports like hunting, fishing, skating, and softball. His friends and family knew him as a “quiet type,” dependable yet not overly assertive. With a build suited to physical labor, standing 5’8” and weighing 150 pounds, he had hazel eyes that hinted at a calm and introspective nature.

Henry’s decision to enlist in the Canadian military came on July 11, 1941, at the age of 19, in Amherst, Nova Scotia. He had a simple reason for joining: he wanted to be with “the rest of the boys.” Soon after, he was posted to the Cape Breton Highlanders of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, marking the beginning of his journey through the trials of World War II.

Initially, Private Scott served in Canada from July 1941 to February 1942, honing his skills and awaiting deployment. In March 1942, he was sent to the United Kingdom, where he spent over a year stationed until October 1943. Then, in late 1943, Henry was deployed to the Italian front, where he would face the hardships and dangers of combat. His primary aspiration in the army was to become a driver, a role suited to his reliable and steady personality. Henry’s superiors saw him as an honest and dependable soldier, with the potential to make an excellent driver, although he wasn’t particularly aggressive.

Private Scott’s journey reached its tragic conclusion on December 26, 1944. He was killed in action in Italy, at just 22 years old. His life and sacrifice are commemorated at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot III, Row B, Grave 3.

Private Henry Coulter Scott’s story is one of quiet service and dedication. Despite his reserved nature, he committed himself to the larger cause, finding purpose in his role with the Cape Breton Highlanders. Though his life was cut short, his legacy endures as a symbol of the quiet courage displayed by countless young men who answered the call to serve.

Letter to Pte Henry Coulter Scott by Dereck Peez, a Canadian student who visited the Cemetery In April 2009 with his hockey team

Dear Sir:
My name is Derek Piitz, I was bom on August seventh 1992 in Calgary, Alberta,
 I am the son of Marty an Jackie and I have two Other siblings. If someone were to ask me
where I would like to be when am twenty two, part of me would say playing professional
hockey and the other part would say getting an education. By the time you were twenty
two you had already died protecting your country and family. I am sure you had goals of
your own, and you have to give them up to go to war. I would like to use this letter to
thank you for all that you for me and all of Canada.
As my hockey team will be visiting the Italian war cemeteries, where you are
buried, I decided to get know you a little better and imagine what it must of felt like in
war. Knowing that you were twenty two years old in battle, born on the sixteenth of
February 1922 and were from Wallace, Nova Scotia made it easier connect to you and
see where you came from. Being sixteen years old it was hard for me to imagine the
harshness of war because we are sixty five years apart and live in different times. lt
probably would have been the scariest moment of my life and knowing that you had a
choice to go to war, shows me how much Canada meant to you. I am also passionate
about my country, but you show the ultimate passion for your country by dying and for
that my respect for you is exceedingly high.
Being a Canadian means so many things to me. Being a hockey player, being
part of the best nation in the world and most importantly being free from terror and fear.
For all those things to be available to me, I finally realize that you and many other brave
soldiers had to give your last breath to fight and defend for the you love.
Knowing that you did that I truly thankful for your bravery and courage and the only way
to give back to you is to live my life to full potential and continue to protect Canada.
Sincerely,
Derek Piitz
