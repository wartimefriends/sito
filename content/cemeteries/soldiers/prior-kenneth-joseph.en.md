Private Kenneth Joseph Prior, a truck driver with the 1st Corps Transport Company of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps (RCASC), served with commitment and courage until his life was tragically cut short on November 1, 1944, during active service in Italy. 
He is buried at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot I, Row C, Grave 5.

Kenneth was born on May 17, 1922, in Arthur, Ontario, in Wellington County. He was the seventh child of John and Elizabeth Prior, part of a large and close-knit family that included three brothers—Norman, John, and Burton—and six sisters, Mrs. Green, Mrs. Breese, Mrs. Craig, Mrs. Jordan, Anna, and Wilma. One of his brothers, Paul, had died in infancy. Raised in a Roman Catholic household, Kenneth’s early years were characterized by a love for sports, particularly baseball, football, and skating, and a natural sense of camaraderie.

Kenneth left school at 13 after completing seven years of public schooling, preferring the hands-on experience of a job over formal education. He began working as a farm laborer, operating trucks and tractors across several farms in Wellington County between 1936 and 1941, gaining practical skills in maintenance and machine operation. Before enlisting, he also worked as a truck driver for a blacksmith named Mr. Smith, transporting cattle safely and reliably. 
His military recruitment officer described him as a high-spirited young man, with a cooperative and friendly demeanor, athletic build, and a natural “horse sense”—a practical, reliable approach to life and work.

Kenneth enlisted in London, Ontario, on September 25, 1941, at the age of 19. 
He entered the 4th Division Petrol Company of the RCASC, training in London, Montreal, and later in Debert and Sussex. Here, he qualified as a Class III driver and was attached to the 5th Canadian Armored Division Transport Company in September 1944. A skilled transport driver, Kenneth preferred active roles that offered a sense of purpose and responsibility. His duties took him overseas, first to the United Kingdom in August 1942, and then to the Italian front in October 1943, where he provided critical transport support through rugged terrain under challenging conditions.

Tragically, Kenneth was killed in action on November 1, 1944, just over a year after his deployment to Italy. His family received news of his sacrifice with deep sorrow, but they also took pride in his commitment and bravery. Kenneth is remembered by those who knew him as a dependable and spirited young man, ready to serve his country and contribute to the greater good.

Today, Kenneth Joseph Prior’s service stands as a testament to the courage and resilience of the Canadian soldiers who served in World War II. His legacy endures in the memory of his family and in the history of those who sacrificed everything in the pursuit of peace and freedom.
