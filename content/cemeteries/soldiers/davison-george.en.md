#### 1 Field Sqn., Royal Canadian Engineers
<br>


Sapper George Davison was born on March 16, 1922, in Vancouver, British Columbia, and raised in Port Coquitlam. The second child of Company Sergeant Major James Davison and Stuart Jackson, George grew up in a family deeply connected to service and sacrifice. His father, a respected figure in the military, instilled in George a sense of duty that would guide his life.

George’s early years were marked by both joy and loss. He grew up with three sisters—Agnes, Jeannie, and Geraldine—and two brothers, Robert James, who passed away at the age of five, and Douglas, who served in the Algonquin Regiment and was tragically killed in action during the war. Despite these challenges, George’s childhood was described as normal and stable, though he left school at age 15 to pursue work.

Standing 5’10” tall and weighing 171 pounds, George was a strong and well-built young man with dark brown hair, brown eyes, and a quiet, reserved demeanor. 
He worked a series of jobs to support himself and his family, including as a helper to a truck driver, a single sawyer at a shingle company, and a fireman for the Canadian Pacific Railway. His weekly wages of $20 to $25 were modest, but George approached each role with dedication and hard work. 
His hobbies included woodworking, hunting, fishing, and playing lacrosse, reflecting a love for both craftsmanship and the outdoors.

George enlisted in the Canadian Army on January 9, 1942, in Vancouver, motivated by a desire to please his father. Initially uncertain about his role, he expressed interest in learning carpentry and hoped for a posting with the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps. 
However, his skill set and aptitude led to his transfer to the Royal Canadian Engineers (RCE), where he trained as a pioneer and carpenter. By May 1944, he was assigned to the 1st Field Squadron, a vital unit responsible for constructing bridges, clearing mines, and supporting infantry operations in combat zones.

George’s military journey began with training in Canada, followed by deployment to the United Kingdom in September 1942. After a year of preparation, he joined the Italian Campaign in October 1943. The work of the Royal Canadian Engineers was arduous and dangerous, requiring ingenuity, strength, and courage to navigate the brutal realities of war.

George served with distinction throughout the Italian Campaign, contributing to the Allied advance through some of the most challenging terrains of the Second World War. His quiet determination and good-natured personality made him a valued member of his squadron. 
Tragically, on December 29, 1944, George was killed in action near Villanova, Italy, during operations critical to the ongoing Allied efforts. 
He was just 21 years old.

Sapper George Davison was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot III, Row C, Grave 5. His grave is a lasting reminder of the sacrifice he made for his country and the ideals of freedom and peace.

George’s story is one of quiet strength and selflessness. From his modest beginnings in Port Coquitlam to his final days on the battlefield in Italy, he embodied the spirit of service and the resilience of his generation. 
His legacy lives on in the memories of his family and comrades and the history of the Royal Canadian Engineers. 
George Davison’s sacrifice is a poignant reminder of the cost of war and the enduring impact of those who gave their lives for a better future.

…
As the second Christmas in Italy came and went, with the usual measure
of good cheer, the Canadian Corps' role became a defensive one. Forward
were either prepared for demolition, or had charges stored handily by
them, and work on defensive minefields began. However General Mark Clark
(late United States Fifth Army Commander), who had succeeded Alexander
(now Supreme Allied Commander Mediterranean) in command of the Allied
Armies in Italy, intended to launch one last push; the Germans still held
Bologna. In anticipation of a Senio crossing below Cotignola, the 1 2th Cana-
dian Field Company had built a 240-foot bridge over the Lamone a mile south
of Boncellino. lt was completed (clas 12) and opened on Christmas Eve. The
Company took the next day to celebrate and, ignoring as best they might the
after effects of the Feast, the men raised the bridge to triple-single, class 40, on
Boxing Day. Appropriate to the season they named it ' 'Three Wise Men
Bridge". The South African engineers constructed another, with amazing
speed —a 240-foot clas 40 Bailey bridge, also over the Lamone, but on the
Ravenna-Russi-Faenza road. Starting work at 1100 hours on 26th December,
they built two piers, assembled, launched and jacked down the spans, com-
pleted the scour precautions, thoroughly cleaned the site, and opened the bridge
to all traffic at 0600 hours on 28th December. However these bridges were
not to be used as planned. Logistics dictated otherwise. The proposed offensive
had to be abandoned.
Two minor improvements still required to be made in the Allied winter
positions and the task, complicated by a temperature just low enough to freeze
the enemy's mines solidly into the ground, began early in the new year. On
the left, the Germans still held a stretch of the Naviglio Canal traversing a
salient that reached from Cotignola to just south of Granarolo. They were
under pressure on the south from the 56th Infantry Division (V Corps) , which
had advanced from Faenza, as well as by Canadian troops to the east and to
some extent to the north. This salient was eliminated between the 3rd and 5th
of January, 1945, in a joint two-brigade operation by the 167th Brigade of
the 56th Division and the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Canadian Division. On the
right, the Canadian Corps' rather extended front dropped well back across the
marshes to the Adriatic. During 2nd January the 5th Division started
Operation "Syria" — the clearing of the area south of the Valli di Comacchio.
lt moved rapidly from Conventello through Sant' Alberto to Casal Borsetti on
the Adriatic. So rapid was the advance that the engineers were hard put to
keep pace. Much of the normal route lay under enemy observation and a
parallel way had to be opened beyond the limits of this observation to carry
the maintenance traffic. The bridge building included 140-foot double-double,
100-foot double-double and 60-foot double-single Bailey bridges. Several
bridges were captured intact, which lessened the work. At one, the Ione
surviving German sapper responsible for the demolition watched admiringly
from his slit trench whilst the bridge was deloused, unable to do his duty
because a lucky shot had severed the firing circuits. He then cheerfully
departed the theatre of war. "Syria" was successfully completed by 6th
January. And so, except for the clashes incidental to a holding role, Canadian
battle activities in Italy came to an end.
