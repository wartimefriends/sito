By the time of his enlistment, he was living in nearby St. Stephen, NB, working as a candy maker for Ganong Bros., a well-known chocolate company where he served as a chocolate mixer and finisher. Hugh, who left school at the age of 15 after completing seven years of public schooling, was remembered as a cooperative, reliable, and good-humored individual. At 5’9” and weighing 140 pounds, with striking blue eyes, he embodied a spirit of commitment and responsibility."

Though dedicated to his trade, Hugh felt a deeper calling, rooted in a sense of duty, which led him to enlist in the Canadian Army on August 6, 1940. 
He joined the 4th Canadian Motorcycle Regiment, later serving with the 8th Princess Louise’s (New Brunswick) Hussars, a unit of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps. Known to friends and family as a man of principle and strong character, he demonstrated his loyalty by leaving the comforts of home and the familiar environment of New Brunswick to serve his country in times of great uncertainty.

Hugh’s service took him across multiple theaters of World War II. He initially served in Canada from his enlistment until October 9, 1941, before embarking for the United Kingdom on October 10, 1941. After spending two years stationed in the UK, he was deployed to Italy on November 15, 1943, where he served until his death on January 3, 1945, at the age of 31. He had by then risen to the rank of Lance Sergeant in “A” Squadron of the 5th Armored Regiment.

Lance Sergeant McHugh died of wounds received in action during the Italian campaign, a crucial and intense phase of the Allied advance. 
His ultimate sacrifice is honored at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot III B 7. 
Though his life was tragically cut short, his legacy endures in the memories of his loved ones. He left behind his wife, Alice Blanche, and his parents, George and Ella. His brothers, Clarence and Ralph, had predeceased him, leaving no siblings to mourn him, but he remains a remembered son of New Brunswick.

From his early days of playing hockey as a left-winger and rugby as a quarterback, to his experience with farming, heavy machinery, and vehicles of all kinds, Hugh embodied a spirit of resilience, dedication, and adaptability. His journey from the candy factory to the battlefields of Europe marked a life defined by service, commitment, and sacrifice for the greater good.
