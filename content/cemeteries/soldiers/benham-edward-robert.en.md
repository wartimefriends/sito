Private Edward Robert
Lanark and Renfrew Regiment

Edward Robert Benham was born on January 8, 1918, in Toronto, Ontario, to Walter and Gertrude Benham. He was one of seven siblings, with two brothers, Walter and Fred, and five sisters, Mrs. Bell, Mrs. Payne, Mrs. Tuller, Mrs. Snider, and Betty. 
Edward grew up in a rural community where his family was deeply rooted in farming, a way of life that shaped his strong work ethic and steady demeanor.

Edward left school after completing most of Grade 8, a decision driven by the practical need to contribute to the family farm. For 11 years, he worked as a farmhand, gaining experience in mixed farming. His days were filled with hard physical labor, leaving little time for hobbies or social activities. 
Nonetheless, Edward enjoyed woodwork and skating when he could spare the time. His calm nature and steady work history earned him the reputation of being reliable and disciplined.

On January 10, 1941, Edward underwent 30 days of training with the 48th Highlanders of Canada but did not remain in the military at that time. His call to full-time service came later, and he enlisted on April 3, 1943, in Toronto, Ontario. 
Though initially shy and unassuming, Edward quickly adapted to military life. His recruiters noted his neat appearance, good physical condition, and solid basic training. While he had no specialized skills, he showed promise as a potential driver, excelling during a partially completed motor transport course. However, the demands of the war required him to serve as an infantryman.

Edward was deployed to the United Kingdom on September 14, 1943, where he continued his training. On January 13, 1944, he arrived in Italy as part of the Canadian forces engaged in the Italian Campaign, a theater of war known for its brutal conditions and relentless fighting. Assigned to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, Edward served with determination and resilience, embodying the quiet strength of his upbringing.

On December 19, 1944, Edward was killed in action during operations near the Senio River in northern Italy. 
He was 25 years old. 
The exact circumstances of his death remain undocumented, but his sacrifice was part of the Allied effort to break through the German defensive lines in the final stages of the campaign.

Edward was laid to rest at the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot V, Row A, Grave 3. 
His life and service exemplify the many young Canadians who left behind the simplicity of rural life to answer the call of duty. Edwardâ€™s commitment, perseverance, and ultimate sacrifice stand as a testament to the quiet heroism of those who served. 
His memory lives on in the records of his regiment and the hearts of those who knew him.
