Born on September 13, 1917, in Dominion, Nova Scotia, Joseph grew up in the heart of a large family in New Aberdeen. He was the tenth of eleven siblings, raised by his mother, Rebecca, and his father, Charles, who passed away when Joseph was just 19 years old. This early loss marked a turning point in Joseph’s life, as he took on responsibilities to support his family, a role he fulfilled with steadfast dedication.

Joseph’s early years were spent attending school, where he started at the age of seven and continued until he was 14, leaving to support his parents after his father’s death. Known for his cheerful and cooperative nature, he had a passion for sports and spent his youth engaged in hunting, hockey, baseball, and rugby. In hockey, he played as a goalie, while in baseball, he manned first base, and in rugby, he took the position of quarterback, showcasing his versatility and strength as a team player.

At 20, Joseph began working for the Dominion Coal Company in Glace Bay, taking on the demanding role of a miner to support his mother and siblings. He worked at the mine for six years, until 1942, enduring difficult and hazardous conditions underground. When part-time work and economic downturns impacted his income, Joseph made a courageous decision to enlist in the army on June 19, 1942, hoping to provide better financial security for his wife, Mildred Ruth, and their two young children, Joseph Jr. and Barbara.

His initial military training took him to various postings across Canada, and in December 1942, he was sent overseas to the United Kingdom, later arriving in Italy in October 1943. Throughout his service, Joseph was noted for his fair, neat appearance and his enthusiasm for the army. He expressed a desire to expand his skills, hoping to study motor or diesel mechanics to contribute further. Despite his lack of prior experience in mechanics, his supervisors recognized his potential and assigned him to general duties in the Royal Canadian Engineers (R.C.E.).

Joseph’s commitment to his family and his responsibilities were unshakable, even amid the war. But in September 1944, tragedy struck when his wife, Mildred Ruth, passed away from tuberculosis at the Glace Bay TB Annex. Left without their mother, Joseph’s two young children, Joseph Jr. and Barbara, were entrusted to the care of their grandmother, Rebecca, by their mother’s will. The loss weighed heavily on Joseph, who had joined the army to support his family and was now separated from his children by both distance and the burdens of war.

Just three months after his wife’s passing, on December 29, 1944, Joseph was killed in action in Italy. His courage and service are forever commemorated at Villanova War Cemetery, where he lies in Plot III, Row C, Grave 6. 
Though Joseph’s life was marked by hardships, his legacy endures through his children, his mother, and his family. The sacrifices he made for his family and his country exemplify the resilience and strength of the countless men and women who served during World War II.
