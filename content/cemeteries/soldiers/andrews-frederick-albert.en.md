<br>


Frederick Albert Andrews was born on December 4, 1919, in Birmingham, Warwickshire, England, to Charles and Edith Emily Andrews.
At the age of seven, Fred immigrated to Canada with his parents and younger brother, Charles Jr., where the family settled in Port Perry, Ontario. It was in this small Canadian town that Fred spent his formative years, embracing both the challenges and opportunities of his new home.

Fred attended school until partway through grade six, leaving at the age of 14 to help on the family farm. Despite his limited formal education, Fred was noted as a good student, particularly enjoying art and the theater. He was musically gifted, playing the accordion, guitar, and harmonica. While sports did not particularly interest him, Fred enjoyed playing softball with friends and neighbors. His quiet hobbies and creative talents painted the picture of a young man who appreciated life’s simpler pleasures.

By the time Fred was 22, the world was engulfed in war, and many young men from Port Perry were answering the call to serve. 
Fred, too, felt compelled to contribute. He initially hoped to join the Royal Canadian Air Force but found the waiting period too long. Undeterred, he enlisted in the Canadian Army on January 6, 1942, in Toronto, Ontario. 
At 5’5½” tall and weighing 132 pounds, Fred may have been small in stature, but he was eager to serve. He became part of the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, known for their bravery and excellence in combat.

Fred’s military training prepared him to serve as a No. 4 gunner on a Light Anti-Aircraft (L.A.A.) gun. He was recognized as a skilled marksman and a dependable soldier. Although he wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about being sent overseas, Fred maintained a positive attitude and strong sense of duty. 
His likable nature earned him the respect of his comrades.

In July 1944, Fred was granted 14 days of combined furlough and embarkation leave. 
During this time, he married Helen May Every, despite not having the army’s permission for the union. The marriage marked a brief moment of joy and normalcy before Fred was deployed to Europe. By late August 1944, Fred was sent to the United Kingdom as part of the Canadian Infantry Reinforcement Unit (CIRU) and then assigned to the Central Mediterranean Force (CMF). 
On September 29, 1944, he arrived in Italy to join the brutal campaign against Axis forces.

Fred fought valiantly through the rugged and unforgiving Italian terrain. The Italian Campaign was marked by fierce resistance from German forces, as well as treacherous weather and difficult conditions. 
In December 1944, Fred and his regiment were tasked with securing the Fosso Munio, a critical defensive position held by German forces. The operation was part of a larger effort to break through enemy lines and push toward victory.

On December 17, 1944, just 12 days after celebrating his 25th birthday, Fred was killed in action during the battle for the Fosso Munio. The fight was grueling and claimed the lives of many brave soldiers. Fred’s death was a devastating loss for his family, friends, and comrades.

Private Frederick Albert Andrews was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot V, Row A, Grave 2. 
Though his life was tragically short, Fred’s courage and sacrifice remain a lasting legacy. His decision to enlist, despite his reservations about overseas duty, speaks to his sense of responsibility and his desire to stand alongside the young men from his hometown in defense of freedom.

Fred’s story is one of quiet strength and unassuming heroism. From a boy with a love for art and music to a soldier who gave his life in service to his country, Fred embodied the values of dedication, resilience, and bravery. His sacrifice, like that of so many others, is a poignant reminder of the cost of war and the enduring gratitude owed to those who gave everything for a better future.
