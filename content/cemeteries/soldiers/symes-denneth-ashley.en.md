<br>


Born on May 27, 1924, in the rural farming community of Minudie, Nova Scotia, Private Denneth Ashley Symes grew up in a close-knit family. His parents, Henry and Alice Symes, raised him along with his three brothers, David, George, and Clifford, and his four sisters, Vera, Lucy Jane, and Mona. The Symes family lived a simple, hardworking life, with Denneth working on the family farm after completing his education at a one-room schoolhouse.

Denneth left school at the age of 17 after completing the ninth grade, where his favorite subject was history. For the next two years, he helped his family with mixed farming and developed experience in managing animals, particularly horses. He also enjoyed playing baseball, usually taking up the position of right field. Slim and slightly self-conscious, Denneth stood 5’ 6 ½” tall and weighed 120 pounds, with brown eyes and brown hair. Those who knew him described him as friendly, cooperative, and willing to help out in any way he could, qualities that served him well in his military career.

On May 6, 1943, at the age of 19, Denneth enlisted in the Canadian Army at Halifax, Nova Scotia, driven by a strong sense of patriotism. He was assigned to No. 6 District Depot General List and trained for military service. Though he initially expressed an interest in serving in the armored corps, he was ultimately transferred to the Cape Breton Highlanders, a regiment in the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps.

Denneth’s military service took him through Canada, the UK, and finally to Italy, where he was deployed in March 1944. Unfortunately, his time in the military would be tragically short. On January 3, 1945, after less than a year in Italy, Private Symes was killed in action, just shy of his 21st birthday. He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot II, Row C, Grave 7.

Though his life was brief, Denneth’s memory lived on with his family, who spoke of him with both sadness and pride. His niece, Myrna Proctor, recounted how he was remembered as a shy but kind young man, always eager to help others. 
The Symes family home was later destroyed by fire, taking with it all of the family’s photographs, including those of Denneth. Despite this loss, his legacy endured through stories and recollections, ensuring that his contribution and sacrifice were never forgotten.
