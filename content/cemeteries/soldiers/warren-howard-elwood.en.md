Howard Elwood WARREN was born on July 5, 1917, in Dunnville, Ontario, where he spent his formative years. The eldest of two children, he was raised by his parents, Richard and Elizabeth Warren, alongside his younger brother, Ralph. Howard’s childhood was marked by a sense of normalcy, and he completed his education up to grade 8 before leaving school at the age of 16.

Howard worked a variety of jobs in his hometown before enlisting in the army. He served as a tool dresser for Sam McKinie, a local contractor, earning $24 a week, and also tried his hand as a self-employed butcher from 1937 to 1938. He sold meats in the surrounding countryside, earning $15 per week. Prior to these, he worked as a mechanic’s helper in a service station in Bismark, Ontario, for a modest wage of $7.50 per week. Despite his various jobs, Howard found it difficult to make ends meet in civilian life, which motivated his decision to enlist in the military. He believed that the army could offer him better financial stability and new opportunities.

On June 2, 1941, Howard enlisted in Hamilton, Ontario, joining the 41st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Canadian Artillery. Standing 5’11” and weighing 146 pounds, he had brown eyes, dark brown hair, and a medium complexion. Described as a carefree man with a good personality, Howard had one ambition in the army: to become a motorcycle instructor, a role that fit his love of motorcycling. He also enjoyed hockey, where he played as a goalie in a local township league, as well as hunting and playing the guitar.

Howard’s military service took him across several theaters of war. After completing his initial training in Canada, he was deployed to the United Kingdom in September 1941. He spent over two years stationed there before being deployed to Italy in October 1943, where he would serve for the remainder of his military career. The Italian Campaign was particularly grueling, with its treacherous terrain and harsh conditions, but Howard continued to serve his regiment faithfully. He worked as a motorcyclist, performing reconnaissance duties for his battery commander. In August 1944, Howard suffered minor injuries in a motorcycle accident when his bike slipped on loose gravel, but he quickly recovered and continued his duties.

Tragically, Howard’s promising military career came to an abrupt and unexpected end on December 24, 1944. On that fateful morning, he had been on guard duty, and though he reported no pain at the time, he later began feeling unwell. After breakfast, he retired to bed, complaining of chest pains and discomfort in his arms. Despite attempts to summon medical help, Howard lost consciousness and passed away shortly thereafter. The cause of death was determined to be coronary sclerosis with recent thrombosis, a natural cause that tragically claimed his life on Christmas Eve.

Howard Elwood Warren was just 28 years old when he died. He was laid to rest in Plot III, Row B, Grave 8 at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy. Though his life was cut short, Howard’s dedication to his country and his unwavering spirit in the face of hardship are remembered with honor.
