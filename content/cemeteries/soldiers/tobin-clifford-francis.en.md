He was born on November 20, 1916, in Youngstown, Alberta, and was tragically killed in action on January 4, 1945, at the age of 28. Lieutenant Tobin is laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Italy, in plot I B 4, a resting place that commemorates his ultimate sacrifice during World War II.

Clifford came from a large and challenging family background. His mother passed away in 1936 when he was just 20 years old, leaving him and his seven siblings to grow up in a broken home. Clifford was the eighth child in the family, with his surviving family consisting of his father, Harry Arthur, and a sister, Mrs. James Connolly. Despite these difficulties, he was known to be cooperative and fair, and his demeanor served him well both in civilian life and later in his military career.

Before enlisting in the military, Clifford led a varied working life. He had completed his education up to Grade XI, after which he worked as a farm laborer and a lumberjack during the winters of 1935-1936 for B. Benson in Wildwood, Alberta. He also had experience as a painter for Dick Whitesides in Innisfail, Alberta. His work was physically demanding, and Clifford thrived in these labor-intensive jobs, showing the resilience and determination that would later serve him well in the military. In August 1938, Clifford made the decision to join the Permanent Force as a soldier with the Lord Strathcona’s Horse (Royal Canadians), marking the beginning of his military career.

Clifford officially enlisted on April 27, 1938, in Calgary, Alberta, where he was stationed at Currie Barracks. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Clifford served in Canada from September 1, 1939, until November 12, 1941, when he was sent overseas to the United Kingdom. He served in the UK from November 13, 1941, to February 18, 1944, and then was deployed to Italy on February 19, 1944. By September 1944, Clifford had been transferred to the 5th Canadian Armoured Regiment (Princess Louise’s Hussars), a prestigious unit within the Canadian Army.

Standing 5 feet 8½ inches tall and weighing 160 pounds, Clifford had a sturdy, athletic build that matched his active participation in sports. He played hockey as a left-winger, boxed, and enjoyed softball, where he was a catcher. His athleticism and competitive spirit were evident in his hobbies and mirrored his tenacity as a soldier. Known for his cooperative and easy-going nature, Clifford adapted well to military life and planned to remain in the army after the war, illustrating his dedication to his country and his chosen path of service.

Lieutenant Tobin’s service spanned the critical years of World War II, and he experienced the intensity of combat firsthand in Italy. As a leader, he demonstrated the qualities that earned him a commission and the respect of his fellow soldiers. Tragically, Clifford Tobin was killed in action on January 4, 1945, while serving in Italy. His comrades remembered him as a capable and courageous officer who had served with distinction.

Though his life was cut short, Clifford Francis Tobin’s legacy lives on through his service and sacrifice, commemorated by the people of Canada and remembered at the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy. 
His commitment to duty and his contributions to the war effort will always be honored.
