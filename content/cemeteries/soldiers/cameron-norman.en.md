Trooper Norman L. Cameron was born on June 8, 1923, in Regina, Saskatchewan, into a loving and hardworking family. He was the second of five children born to William L. and Eva May Cameron, with one brother, Donald, and three sisters, including Mrs. David Johnson, Marion, and Helen. Raised on his family’s farm in St. Ann’s, Ontario, Norman’s upbringing was grounded in the values of diligence and community.

Norman’s education included Grade IX at an urban high school in Ontario, where he studied mixed materials and vocational subjects, including sheet metal work in Grade X. Intelligent and ambitious, Norman’s hobbies included stamp collecting, while his athletic pursuits featured swimming, hockey (right wing), and baseball (shortstop).

Norman worked hard from a young age, assisting on his father’s mixed farm until 1942. In addition to his farm work, he spent two months as a machine operator’s helper at Hay Steel Company and later became a truck driver for Adams Furniture Company in St. Catharines, Ontario, earning $28.50 a week. His experience as a truck driver instilled in him a strong mechanical aptitude and a passion for vehicles, which he hoped to further develop through automotive trade training in the military.

At 5’11” and 167 pounds, with blue eyes, fair hair, and a friendly demeanor, Norman was described as energetic, affable, and responsive. Despite a minor injury to his ankle in 1939, which healed well, he was in excellent health and wore glasses only for close work. His mechanical aptitude and work ethic, paired with his eagerness to learn and determination to succeed, made him an ideal candidate for military service.

On October 26, 1942, Norman enlisted in Hamilton, Ontario, driven by a sense of camaraderie and a desire to serve alongside friends who had already joined the military. He was assigned to the Governor General’s Horse Guards (GGHG), part of the Canadian Armoured Corps.

Norman’s military journey began in Canada, where he underwent training until May 1943. He was then deployed to the United Kingdom, where he honed his skills in preparation for combat. 
In November 1943, he joined the Italian Campaign, a grueling theater of the Second World War that tested the resilience and courage of Allied forces.

Serving in Italy, Norman proved himself a smart, reliable soldier who embraced the challenges of armoured warfare. 
His natural aptitude for driving and maintaining vehicles, along with his energetic and positive attitude, made him a valued member of his regiment. However, his time in service also exposed him to the harsh realities of war.

Tragically, on December 24, 1944, during combat near Villanova, Italy, Norman was killed in action. He was just 22 years old. 
His death was a profound loss to his family, who had eagerly awaited his return, and to his comrades, who valued his skill and friendship.

From the GGHG’s War Diary:
'Just before first light on 24 December 'A' Squadron moved cross country to thr Via Bellaria, waiting for first light to move north toward the Via Rosetta. As this move was taking place, the forward Stuart of Murray's Second Troop was knocked out at close range by a panzerfaust. When the crew bailed out they were engaged by machine guns, and Troopers Norman Cameron and Howard Homes were killed.'

Trooper Norman L. Cameron was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot V, Row C, Grave 3. His grave stands as a solemn reminder of the price of freedom and the courage of those who fought for it.

Norman’s story is one of a hardworking farm boy with big dreams, who answered his country’s call with determination and a desire to make a difference. Though his life was tragically brief, his sacrifice embodies the spirit of a generation that gave everything for a brighter future.

His legacy lives on in the hearts of his family, his community, and the history of the Governor General’s Horse Guards. 
Norman’s sacrifice reminds us of the profound cost of war and the enduring impact of those who gave their all for freedom.
