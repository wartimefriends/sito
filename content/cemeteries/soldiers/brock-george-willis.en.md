2nd Armoured Regiment, Lord Strathcona’s Horse - R. C. A. C. 

Born on December 14, 1919, in Manola, Alberta, George grew up in a large and close-knit family as the second of nine children. His parents, George Albert and Geneva Joyce, raised him alongside his brothers Clarence and Lawrence and sisters Nellie Forberg, Geneva St. Louis, Cecelia, Doris, Dorothy, and Joyce on a mixed farm in Manola, instilling in him values of hard work and community.

George completed Grade 8 before leaving school at the age of 15 to help support his family. From 1935 to 1940, he worked tirelessly on his father’s farm, gaining practical skills and a strong work ethic. He developed a passion for sports and the outdoors, enjoying swimming, hunting, boxing, and playing hockey as a defenseman and baseball as a third baseman. At 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 165 pounds, George was described as a capable and determined young man with blue eyes and a resilient spirit. His ambition to become a driver mechanic reflected his mechanical aptitude and interest in practical, hands-on work.

On May 22, 1941, George enlisted in Edmonton, Alberta, beginning his military journey with No. 13A District Depot. After completing initial training at TC Huntingdon and the Armoured Corps Advanced Training Centre in Borden, Ontario, he was taken on strength with the 2nd Armoured Regiment, Lord Strathcona’s Horse, in November 1941. Shortly afterward, he embarked for overseas service, arriving in the United Kingdom to prepare for combat.

George’s role in the armoured regiment demanded technical expertise, physical stamina, and unwavering determination. In August 1943, he qualified as a Tank Crewman Operator, a vital role within his unit. 
Soon after, he was deployed to the Italian Campaign, disembarking in November 1943. The campaign’s harsh conditions and relentless battles tested every soldier’s resilience.

Throughout his time in Italy, George served with distinction, showcasing his skill and dedication. However, on December 28, 1944, during operations near Villanova, Italy, George was killed in action. He was just 24 years old. His death was a devastating loss to his family, who had eagerly awaited his return, and to his comrades, who valued his reliability and bravery.

Corporal George Willis Brock was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery, Plot III, Row B, Grave 6. His grave serves as a solemn reminder of the ultimate sacrifice he made for his country and for the ideals of freedom and peace.

George’s story is one of dedication, resilience, and service. From the fields of Manola, Alberta, to the battlefields of Italy, he embodied the courage and determination of his generation. His memory lives on in the hearts of his family, his community, and the legacy of the Lord Strathcona’s Horse (Royal Canadians). Corporal George Willis Brock’s sacrifice reminds us of the immense cost of war and the enduring gratitude owed to those who gave everything for a better future.
