title = "Captain Frank Sydney STEBBENS served with the 11th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, during World War II."
+++

He was born on March 28, 1907, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and passed away from wounds on December 15, 1944, at the age of 38, during the Italian Campaign. He is buried at Villanova War Cemetery, plot VII A 1.

Frank was the eldest of four children in his family, which included his parents Frank and Ida Stebbens, and his siblings Eddie, Marjorie, and Eva. Although he was divorced, he had a daughter, Ida Gail, who was his next of kin. Ida Gail lived at the Sisters of the Holy Cross Convent in Montreal for much of the year, with her grandmother taking care of her in her father’s absence.

Captain Stebbens’ early life saw him complete high school with a commercial diploma. He went on to complete an electrical course at Bell Telephone Co., and later worked for two years in land surveying with the Canadian Pacific Railway’s engineering department in Winnipeg. Prior to his military service, he worked as a sales manager in the dairy industry.

Frank enlisted in the military on August 12, 1940, joining the 2/8 Field Battery, RCA, a non-permanent active militia unit, as a second lieutenant. After a period of training in Canada, he was transferred overseas. From September 1941 to January 1943, he served in Canada, then was sent to the UK, and eventually deployed to Italy on October 25, 1943.

Captain Stebbens was described as a tall man, standing 6 feet 1 inch and weighing 170 pounds, with hazel eyes, brown hair, and a medium complexion. He wore glasses for reading.

Tragically, on 16 December 1944, Frank suffered multiple shrapnel wounds to the head and chest from an explosive shell. He was taken to the 165 British Advanced Dressing Station but had already succumbed to his injuries by the time he arrived. His niece later recalled a family story that Frank had gone out to find Christmas presents for his troops when he was killed by a sniper, although military records confirm he died from high-explosive shrapnel wounds.

Frank’s death left a profound impact on his family, with his niece Phyllis-Ann remembering the Christmas Day when her grandfather received the telegram informing them of Frank’s death. Though her memories are from a child’s perspective, she vividly recalls the somber mood of that day.

Captain Frank Sydney Stebbens is remembered for his dedication to his country, and his name lives on, inscribed in honor at Villanova War Cemetery, where he lies among his fallen comrades.
