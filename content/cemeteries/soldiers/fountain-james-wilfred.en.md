James Wilfred Fountain was born on May 3, 1922, in Sharon, Ontario, to Wilfred and Ella May Fountain. He was the youngest of four children, with an older brother, Herbert Roswall, and two sisters, Vera Myrtle and Ethel May. James grew up in a close-knit family, but his life was marked by the loss of his mother, who passed away on October 27, 1943.

James completed eight years of public school before entering the workforce. He took on roles as an assembler and trimmer in office equipment manufacturing and also worked for a year as a plumber’s helper. Standing 5’5½” tall and weighing 160 pounds, James had a medium complexion, brown eyes, and brown hair. Known for his strong and healthy physique, he was an active young man who enjoyed playing various sports.

Described as cooperative, alert, and well-mannered, James demonstrated average intelligence and a stable disposition. He expressed an interest in automotive mechanics and aspired to take a driver’s course to develop his skills further. His enlistment on July 22, 1943, at Camp Borden, Ontario, was a result of a call-up for military service.

James was assigned to the Number 10 Canadian Infantry Training Center before being taken on strength with the Irish Regiment of Canada on May 27, 1944, in Italy. His journey began with training in Canada from July to November 1943, followed by deployment to the United Kingdom from November 1943 to February 1944. 
On February 18, 1944, James arrived in Italy, joining the regiment in one of the most challenging theaters of the Second World War.

As a member of C Company, James participated in the intense and grueling Italian Campaign, which demanded resilience and courage amidst harsh conditions and relentless combat. 
Tragically, on December 20, 1944, at the age of 22, James was killed in action during operations near the Fossa Munio River as part of the battle for the Senio River.

James Wilfred Fountain was laid to rest in the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, where his grave stands as a tribute to his service and sacrifice. 
His journey, from a small town in Ontario to the battlefields of Italy, reflects the determination and sense of duty that defined his generation.

Though his life was cut short, James’s memory endures in the hearts of his family and in the legacy of the Irish Regiment of Canada. 
His story is a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by so many in the fight for freedom and peace.
