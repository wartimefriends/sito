John William MacAULAY was born on May 27, 1916, in the peaceful farming community of Cardigan, Prince Edward Island. 
Raised in a close-knit family, John was the son of Daniel Charles MacAulay and his late mother, Rosella. He grew up alongside his two brothers, Joseph and Peter, and his three sisters, one of whom later moved to Halifax, while another stayed in Cardigan. Like many young men from rural backgrounds, John developed a strong work ethic early in life. He spent three years as a laborer on his family’s farm and also worked as a railroad section hand for two years. Even as he worked, John harbored ambitions for a future as a blacksmith, envisioning a life centered around his love for working with his hands.

John completed two years of high school, reaching Grade XI, and excelled in sports, particularly rugby, baseball, hockey, and handball. These activities gave him a sense of camaraderie and discipline, traits that would later serve him well in his military career. He was known for his good physique, stable attitude, and a moderate approach to both drinking and smoking. Standing 5’8½” tall and weighing 165 pounds, he was well-suited for the physical demands of military life.

On September 1, 1939, with the outbreak of World War II, John enlisted in the Canadian Army in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. He joined the Prince Edward Island Highlanders (PEIH), inspired by a sense of duty and a readiness to serve his country. His previous experience in the high school cadets and the Non-Permanent Active Militia (NPAM) with the PEIH prepared him for the discipline and rigor of military service. Initially assigned to infantry, he displayed qualities that made him a promising candidate for a non-commissioned officer, with commendable command skills and a cooperative attitude.

John’s service began in Canada, where he trained and prepared for deployment abroad. In June 1943, he was sent to the United Kingdom, marking the beginning of his overseas journey. Later that year, in October, he arrived in Italy as part of the Allied efforts to push back Axis forces. John was reassigned to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment in October 1944, just a few weeks before he would face the intense battles of the Italian Campaign. The regiment played a crucial role in advancing through the challenging Italian terrain, where soldiers faced not only enemy fire but also harsh weather and difficult landscapes.

Throughout his service, John remained steadfast and determined. He approached his duties with the same dedication he had shown on the farm and the sports field. Known for his good learning ability and strong sense of stability, he was well-regarded by his comrades and superiors alike. Though he was thousands of miles from home, John carried with him the values and resilience of his rural upbringing, maintaining a sense of hope for a future after the war.

Tragically, on December 13, 1944, John William MacAulay was killed in action during fierce fighting in the area of the Naviglio Canal at Villa Prati, Bagnacavallo. 
His passing left a void in the lives of his family and friends, who mourned the loss of a son, brother, and soldier who had given his life for his country. He was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, where his grave stands as a symbol of his bravery and sacrifice.

John’s story is one of service, resilience, and dedication. From a farm laborer in Prince Edward Island to a soldier on the front lines in Italy, he embodied the spirit of Canada’s wartime generation. His ambitions for the future and his sacrifices in the present painted a portrait of a young man who was willing to give everything for a cause greater than himself. 
Private John William MacAulay’s legacy endures, a reminder of the courage and commitment of those who served and the profound sacrifices they made for freedom.
