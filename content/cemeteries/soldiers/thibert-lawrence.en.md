<br>


Private Lawrence THIBERT, service number A102099, served with the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps (R.C.I.C.). 

He was born on March 1, 1921, in Tilbury, Ontario, and was only 23 years old when he was killed in action on December 19, 1944 in the area of the Fosso Munio. 
He now rests at the Villanova War Cemetery, Italy, in Plot V, Row A, Grave 1.

Lawrence was the son of Gilbert Thibert, a laborer, and Leona Giroux. He grew up in a modest French-Canadian family and was one of four children, with an older brother Alphonse and two sisters, Aurise and Elaine (the latter passed away as an infant). The family resided in Windsor, Ontario, where Lawrence lived prior to enlisting.

Lawrence completed his education up to the 9th grade, having repeated the 8th grade. He was bilingual, speaking both English and French. Although his academic performance was not particularly strong—he was described as “just passing” most of the time—he was hardworking and determined. Lawrence had been employed in various jobs before joining the army, working for a year as a grocery clerk and order boy, and later spending 15 months as a packer at the Ford Motor Company in Windsor, where he dealt with Universal Carrier parts. His ambition was to work as a stockman, and his work ethic reflected his commitment to supporting his family.

Lawrence was described as small and thin but physically fit. He was active in sports and enjoyed playing hockey, baseball, bowling, and billiards. Despite his somewhat below-average intelligence, Lawrence displayed average emotional stability, and his enthusiasm for both his work and leisure activities was evident.

Lawrence enlisted on May 5, 1942, in Windsor, Ontario, driven by a desire to serve overseas. Initially placed with the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (R.C.O.C.), he was trained as a storeman, which suited his prior experience as a stockman. After serving in Canada until August 1942, he was sent to the United Kingdom, where he remained until September 1944. That month, he was deployed to Italy as part of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment.

Private Thibert’s time in Italy was tragically short. Just a few months after arriving in the theater of war, he was killed in action on December 19, 1944, as the regiment fought in one of the final phases of the Italian Campaign. His sacrifice, like that of so many others, contributed to the eventual liberation of Europe during World War II.

Though small in stature, Lawrence Thibert’s courage and dedication were enormous. His family, friends, and comrades continue to honor his memory as he rests among the many who gave their lives in the pursuit of peace and freedom.
