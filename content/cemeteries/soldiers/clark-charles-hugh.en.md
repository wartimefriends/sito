4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps

Charles Hugh Clark was born on October 24, 1920, in Edmonton, Alberta. The youngest of three siblings, Charles grew up with his two older sisters, Mrs. A.G. Verchere and Mrs. W.R. McCutcheon. Raised by his parents, Charles Hugh Berton and Martha V. Clark, he was known for his intelligence, athleticism, and leadership potential.

Charles completed Grade 12 and displayed a natural aptitude for learning and problem-solving. His hobbies included radio mechanics and playing the saxophone, while his sporting interests ranged from hockey (defense) and rugby (line) to swimming, skiing, softball, and football. 
Before enlisting, Charles worked as an apprentice druggist at Merrick Drug Store in Edmonton, earning $10.00 a week. Though initially interested in becoming a mining engineer, he was drawn to the military by a sense of duty and excitement.

On September 8, 1939, Charles enlisted in Edmonton, joining the No. 4 Casualty Clearing Station (C.C.S.) of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps (R.C.A.M.C.). He had prior service with the 17th Cavalry Field Ambulance, R.C.A.M.C., beginning in June 1938, which prepared him for the challenges ahead. 
His enlistment reflected not only a desire to serve his country but also an aspiration to gain experience in handling drugs, though his role later evolved beyond the medical field.

Charles’ military journey began in Canada, where he trained until January 1940. He was then deployed to the United Kingdom, serving there until June 1943. Subsequently, he joined the Italian Campaign, one of the most grueling theaters of the Second World War. By September 1944, Charles was transferred to the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (PLDG), a reconnaissance regiment within the Canadian Armoured Corps. His adaptability and leadership qualities made him an asset to every unit he joined.

Standing 5’8½” tall and weighing 145 pounds, Charles was a fair-complexioned, light-brown-haired young man with brown eyes. He was described by his superiors as a clean-cut, intelligent individual with a natural aptitude for leadership. Although he initially hoped to pursue officer training, he was advised to gain more experience handling men before applying again. This led to his reassignment to roles where he could further develop his skills.

On December 31, 1944, during a mission near the Senio River in Italy, Charles was tasked with locating an enemy gun position as a section leader. While approaching the riverbank, an enemy light machine gun opened fire, striking him in the head. 
He succumbed to his injuries within minutes. Charles was 23 years old.

Sergeant Charles Hugh Clark was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Italy, where he lies in Plot I, Row C, Grave 4. His grave serves as a solemn reminder of a life dedicated to service and sacrifice.

Charles’ story is one of ambition, courage, and selflessness. From his early days as an apprentice druggist in Edmonton to his role as a section leader in Italy, he embodied the values of duty, resilience, and leadership. His legacy lives on in the hearts of his family, his comrades, and the history of the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards. 
Sergeant Charles Hugh Clark’s sacrifice is a poignant reminder of the cost of war and the enduring impact of those who gave everything for freedom and peace.
