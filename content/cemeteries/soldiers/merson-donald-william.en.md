Private Donald William MERSON was a dedicated soldier and a hard-working man, whose life journey was defined by commitment to both family and duty. 
Born on June 4, 1913, in Toronto, Ontario, Donald grew up in a modest household as the son of William and Rose Poole. He was a devoted husband to Frances Alice and a loving father to their two children, Donald William and Garry Fredrick.

Donald’s early life was marked by responsibility and determination. He left school after completing part of Grade VIII, at the age of 14, to support his family during difficult times. He quickly immersed himself in the working world, taking on a variety of jobs that showcased his versatility and dedication. Over the years, he worked as a bicycle delivery boy, an office assistant, a factory worker, and a bottler. Eventually, he found stable work as an operator and automatic set-up man at the John Inglis Company, where he was employed for the four years leading up to his enlistment.

Donald’s sense of duty extended beyond his civilian life. He had previous military experience, having served with the Non-Permanent Active Militia (N.P.A.M.) in the Queen’s Own Rifles as a bugler from 1931 to 1935 and later with the Toronto Scottish as a rifleman from 1935 to 1938. He also attended summer camps at Camp Niagara, where he even served as a cook one year, discovering a fondness for the role.

On November 1, 1943, at the age of 30, Donald enlisted again in Toronto, this time to serve his country during the Second World War. He joined the Perth Regiment and soon began training. Described as a responsive, hardworking man of average height and slender build, standing 5’9” and weighing 146 pounds, he quickly adapted to military life. Though his training evaluations noted that he could be stubborn and wasn’t the most popular in his unit, he was recognized for his strong work ethic, mechanical skills, and interest in automotive mechanics. His instructors recommended him for a role as a trades trainee in the RCASC Catering Group, though he later trained as a driver and qualified to operate both wheeled and tracked vehicles.

In August 1944, Donald was deployed overseas, arriving in the United Kingdom, and by November, he was assigned to Italy. As part of the Perth Regiment, he was immersed in the grueling Italian Campaign, where Canadian forces faced harsh conditions and relentless opposition from Axis forces. Despite the challenges, Donald’s perseverance and dedication carried him through.

Tragically, on December 20, 1944, Private Donald William Merson was killed in action at the age of 31. 
His service and sacrifice are commemorated at Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, where he rests in Plot IV, Row C, Grave 7. 
His family in Toronto mourned his loss, cherishing the memory of a man who worked tirelessly to support those he loved and who answered the call to defend his country in its time of need.

Donald’s life was one of resilience, shaped by hard work, responsibility, and an unwavering commitment to his family and his duties. 
His story, like those of many others who served, reflects the courage and sacrifices made by countless men and women during one of history’s darkest times.
