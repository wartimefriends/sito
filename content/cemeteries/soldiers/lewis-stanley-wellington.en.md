Stanley Wellington Lewis was born on July 16, 1916, in Valor, Saskatchewan, the son of Henry Wellington Lewis and Edna Elvira Lewis. Raised on a family farm in a Welsh-Scottish household, Stanley grew up with two brothers, Norval and Kenneth, and two sisters, Verna and Dorothy. His childhood on the farm shaped his work ethic and skills, preparing him for the responsibilities that lay ahead in his life.

Stanley attended school until Grade 10, leaving formal education to work full-time. His occupational background included nearly two decades of mixed farming, primarily helping his father manage the family farm. 
He also worked as a house-to-house salesman for Fuller Brush Co. in Saskatoon, earning $20 per week selling brushes and washing machines. At the time of his enlistment, Stanley was delivering meat for a butcher in Assiniboia, Saskatchewan. Despite his varied work experience, his ambition was to become a store clerk, a role he hoped to pursue after the war.

Standing 5’11” and weighing 155 pounds, Stanley had brown eyes, a cooperative disposition, and a well-groomed appearance. His hobbies included skating and singing, and he was skilled in driving heavy and light trucks, autos, and tractors. Described as accident-free and responsible, he brought reliability and determination to all his endeavors. 
Married to Lillian Emily May, the couple had one son, Robert James, born on October 28, 1942.

Driven by a strong sense of duty, Stanley enlisted in the Canadian Army on April 10, 1941, in Regina, Saskatchewan. He began his military journey with the 12th District Depot of the Canadian Army Active Force. Over the next two years, he underwent extensive training across Canada, including advanced infantry training in Winnipeg and specialized courses in Woodstock, Ontario, and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Stanley was recognized as a cooperative and capable soldier, with a satisfactory performance in map reading and other military skills.

In September 1942, Stanley was deployed to the United Kingdom, where he served for nearly a year before being sent to Italy in August 1943. Joining the grueling Italian Campaign, he faced some of the most challenging conditions of the war. His service with the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment, part of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, placed him at the heart of intense combat operations. Stanley demonstrated resilience and dedication throughout his service, qualities that earned him the respect of his comrades and commanders.

Tragically, Stanley’s journey came to an end on December 13, 1944, when he was killed in action in Italy. He was 28 years old. 
Stanley was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, where his grave in Plot VII, Row B, Grave 10 stands as a testament to his courage and sacrifice.

Private Stanley Wellington Lewis exemplified the values of dedication, loyalty, and perseverance. From his early days on the family farm to his service overseas, he lived a life of unwavering commitment to his family and his country. 
His legacy endures in the memory of those who knew him and in the pages of history, where his name is honored as one who gave his life for the cause of freedom.
