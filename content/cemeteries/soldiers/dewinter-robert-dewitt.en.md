4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards R.C.I.C.

A Youthful Spirit Sacrificed for Freedom:

Private Robert Dewitt DeWinter was born on September 21, 1924, in Aylesford, Kings County, Nova Scotia. The son of Allison Ira and Emily Matilda DeWinter, Robert grew up in a hardworking family with three brothers—Aubrey, Gordon (serving overseas during the war), and Vaughan—and two sisters, Jennie, Agnes (Mrs. West), and Iona (Mrs. Morse). His father worked in milling, and the family’s roots in the rural community instilled values of resilience and determination in Robert from a young age.

Robert completed Grade 8 before leaving school to help support his family. His early years were spent working as a mechanic’s helper in a garage and as a general laborer in a mill, earning an average of $10 per week. 
Despite his modest background, Robert was known for his “happy-go-lucky” attitude, youthful enthusiasm, and willingness to serve. Standing 5’10” tall and weighing 167 pounds, he had an average build and a lively demeanor that reflected his zest for life.

Robert’s hobbies included playing baseball and the guitar, and he enjoyed reading newspapers to stay informed. Though his maturity and mechanical aptitude were noted as developing, Robert’s eagerness to learn and serve made him a valuable candidate for military service. He enlisted in the Canadian Army on February 8, 1943, in Kentville, Nova Scotia, joining the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards (PLDG), part of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps.

Before enlisting, Robert had been part of the Reserve Formation with the 2nd Battalion, West Nova Scotia Regiment, since May 1942. 
His military journey began in Canada, where he underwent basic and advanced training. Though initially transferred between various corps and positions due to the demands of the war effort, he eventually found his place in the infantry, a role that would test his resolve and courage.

In June 1944, Robert was deployed to the United Kingdom, where he trained for the realities of combat. 
The following month, he joined the Italian Campaign, one of the most arduous theaters of the Second World War. As part of the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, Robert took on the challenges of reconnaissance missions and frontline combat, a role that demanded bravery and endurance.

Despite his relatively short time in active service, Robert’s dedication and youthful optimism were evident. However, the harsh realities of war would soon claim him.

On December 12 the Dragoons encountered strong resistance along the Naviglio Canal banks, west of Revanna. Only 2 squadrons of the Dragoons made it across and were scattered because of fierce counterattacks. 

On December 13 Intelligence reports that the Kesselring Machine Gun Battalion is opposite to them; consisting of 3 companies of 110 men each, 16 MG’s, 40 sub-machine guns and 20 bazookas. Fierce fighting continued. 

The dragoons suffered heavy casualties. Robert DeWitt DeWinter was one of those killed on December 13. 
He was just 20 years old.

Private Robert Dewitt DeWinter was laid to rest in the Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, Plot I, Row A, Grave 10. His grave serves as a lasting tribute to a young man who gave his life in the pursuit of freedom and peace.

Robert’s story is one of a small-town boy with big dreams and an adventurous spirit who answered his country’s call. Though his life was tragically cut short, his sacrifice embodies the spirit of a generation that stepped forward, often at great personal cost, to fight for a better future.

His legacy lives on in the hearts of his family, his community, and the history of those who served in the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards. 
Robert’s sacrifice reminds us of the profound cost of war and the enduring impact of those who gave their all for freedom.
