John William Ross Beckett was born on November 25, 1923, on a farm in Effingham, Ontario, a community settled by his Beckett ancestors. 
He was the eighth of eleven children born to Levi R. and Olive A. Beckett. The Beckett family, consisting of three boys and eight girls, was close-knit and industrious, embodying the spirit of rural Canadian life. John was especially close to his younger sister Lena, one of a pair of twins, who fondly recalled the deep bond they shared.

John grew up helping on the family farm and attending the local school. He left school after completing Grade 8, driven by a restless ambition to experience life and contribute to his family. At the age of 15, he began working in various jobs, including on farms, at the Font Hill golf course, and later as a laborer at the International Nickel Company in Port Colborne. His passion for machinery and the outdoors defined his early years, and he also enjoyed building model airplanes and playing pool.

When World War II began, John was determined to serve his country. 
At just 18, he enlisted on August 29, 1942, in Hamilton, Ontario, joining the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps. However, John’s eagerness to serve predated his official enlistment. He had initially joined the 2nd 10th Dragoons while underage but was honorably discharged when his age was discovered. Undeterred, he reenlisted as soon as he was eligible and embarked on a journey that would lead him overseas.

John was deployed to the United Kingdom in March 1943 and to Italy in June 1943, becoming part of the Italian Campaign. His military service was marked by both determination and resilience. Despite his lack of formal education, John’s natural leadership abilities stood out. He was noted for his good manners, strong physique, and steady character. Although the army considered him for officer training, his educational background made this path unfeasible. Still, he excelled in his role and rose to the rank of Lance Corporal. 
At the time of his death, he was acting as a Sergeant due to significant losses in his division.

On December 16, 1944, less than a month after his 21st birthday, John was killed in action in Italy during the grueling fighting of the Italian Campaign. 
His death came just months after his older brother, Everden, was wounded in France, leaving him a paraplegic for the remainder of his life. John’s sacrifice left a profound impact on his family, who had already endured great hardship due to the war.

John is buried at the Villanova Canadian War Cemetery in Italy, in Plot V, Row A, Grave 4. His family, especially Lena, cherished his memory and preserved his medals, his Certificate of Service, and the Silver Cross awarded to his mother. Lena recalled her brother as a spirited and ambitious young man who “could not wait to live” and brought warmth and joy to those around him.

The legacy of John William Ross Beckett is one of determination, sacrifice, and courage. His life, though tragically cut short, stands as a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit and the heavy cost of war borne by so many young Canadians and their families.


Letter from Mrs Lena Becket Smith, John’s sister dated February 2010

I am Lena (Beckett) Smith, sister of the late L/Cpl. John William Ross Beckett, whom I understand you were looking for info on for the Villanova War Cemetery.
John was born on a farm in a local community settled by Beckett ancestors. It is known as Effingham, formerly Becketts Mills. It is signed that way. He was born Nov 25, 1923 & was killed in action Dec 16, 1944, less than a month after his 21st birthday, It was only a few months after his older brother Everden was wounded by shrapnel in his back at Caen France. He came home as a paraplegic & spent the remainder of his life in a wheel chair. According to the telegram which the army sent to my Mother informing her of John's death, he was an acting Sgt. due to the severe loss of soldiers in his division, at the time of his death.
John signed up for action when he was not yet old enough. When this was discovered he was honorably discharged. As soon as his birthday came he signed up again. Soon after that he was sent overseas.
John was the 8th member of his family of 11. There was a set of twin sisters & a younger brother after him. I am one of the twins & next in line to him in the family. There were 8 girls & 3 boys in our family. There are now 3 girls left & no boys. He & I were very close & enjoyed each others company very much & spent a lot of time together.
He could not wait to live, & quit school after grade 8, & went to work. At the time he signed up, he worked at the International Nickel Plant in Port Colborne, Ont. He wanted to join the Paratroopers but it was discovered that he had many previously broken bones, (which no one knew about) except for one incident. The army wanted to make him an officer but he did not have the necessary education, but did have the ability. I will send a photo of him but cannot do it in this letter.
I have his metals & his Certificate of Service, the telegram sent to Mom & Dad re: his death, & Mom's Siver Cross for his sacrifice.

Lena (Beckett) Smith
