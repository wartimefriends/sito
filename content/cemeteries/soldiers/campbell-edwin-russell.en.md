A Modest Life Devoted to Duty

Private Edwin Russell Campbell was born on March 16, 1919, in Eston, Saskatchewan, the fourth of seven children in a family weathering the hardships of the Great Depression. His father, William Edward Lorne, left the family in 1930, leaving Edwin’s mother, Lillian May, to care for her children in Lacadena, Saskatchewan. Edwin grew up with four brothers—Frederick Lorne, Everett Francis, John Peter, and Leslie William—and two sisters, Mrs. Vernon Maguire and Mildred May.

Edwin completed Grade 8 before leaving school to support his family. He worked tirelessly as a farm laborer and truck driver, taking on various jobs with M.E. Mercer and G.E. Giles in Wartime, Saskatchewan. Despite earning modest wages of $8–$15 a week, Edwin provided partial support for his mother and brother. His hobbies reflected his practical nature, including a love of engines and mechanics. 
He also enjoyed hunting and sports such as hockey, where he played as a forward, and softball.

Standing 5’7¾” tall and weighing 155 pounds, Edwin was a man of medium build with hazel eyes, dark hair, and a dark complexion. Though quiet and unassuming, he possessed a strong work ethic and practical skills as a truck driver and mechanic. Despite losing the first joint of his left-hand index finger, Edwin continued to excel in manual tasks, reflecting his determination and resilience.

On June 24, 1941, Edwin enlisted in the Canadian Army in Rosetown, Saskatchewan. When asked why he joined, his response was simple yet poignant: “Somebody has to join.” 
Initially assigned to the 67th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Canadian Artillery, Edwin began his military training in Canada before being deployed to the United Kingdom in November 1941. Over the next two years, he prepared for the challenges of war, eventually being redesignated to the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment in October 1944.

In June 1943, Edwin arrived in Italy, joining one of the most grueling campaigns of the Second World War. The Italian Campaign tested the mettle of every soldier, and Edwin’s quiet determination and mechanical aptitude made him an asset to his regiment.

Tragically, Edwin’s journey came to an end on December 13, 1944, during combat near Villanova, Italy. He was killed in action at the age of 25. 
His death was a devastating loss for his family, who had already endured so much, and for his comrades, who valued his steady presence and dedication.

Private Edwin Russell Campbell was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery, Plot VI, Row B, Grave 7. His grave stands as a testament to the sacrifices made by ordinary men in extraordinary times.

Edwin’s story is one of quiet perseverance and selflessness. From his modest beginnings in Saskatchewan to the battlefields of Italy, he embodied the qualities of duty and resilience that defined his generation. 
Though he may not have sought recognition or glory, his service and sacrifice were vital to the cause of freedom.

His memory lives on in the hearts of his family, his community, and the history of the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish Regiment. 
Edwin’s story reminds us of the countless individuals who gave everything for a better future, and whose legacy continues to inspire gratitude and respect.
