Private Arthur James Diwell was born on July 21, 1916, in Owen Sound, Ontario, into a large and loving family. The son of Thomas Henry and Caroline Diwell, Arthur grew up with three brothers—Henry, Chas, and George—and three sisters—Jessie, Winnifred, and Anne. Tragically, his mother and two siblings, Thomas and Anne, passed away during his early years. Despite these losses, Arthur’s upbringing was marked by resilience and a strong sense of responsibility.

Arthur’s education concluded at Grade 7, after which he entered the workforce at 16 to support himself. 
He worked tirelessly across several occupations, including 14 months as a delivery boy, 18 months as a laborer at Humberstone Shoe Company, and seven years as a machine operator at International Nickel Company in Port Colborne, Ontario. 
In addition to his industrial work, Arthur had a passion for farming and dreamed of running his own farm after the war.

On January 8, 1938, Arthur married Emma Rose Anne, beginning a new chapter as a devoted husband and father. Together, they welcomed three children: Robert, Barbara, and Kathleen, the youngest born while Arthur was serving in Italy in July 1944. 
He cherished his family life, finding joy in his garden, car repairs, and the quiet comforts of home. Despite his many responsibilities, Arthur made time for hobbies such as hunting, baseball, hockey, and rugby, and enjoyed reading detective and Wild West stories.

Standing 5’8½” tall and weighing 160 pounds, Arthur was described as a pleasant, responsive man with a strong work ethic and a cooperative attitude. His commitment to his family and community was matched by his dedication to his country. 
On September 14, 1943, he enlisted in Toronto, Ontario, joining the Perth Regiment of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps.

Arthur’s military service began with basic training, where he quickly earned a reputation as a quiet, cool, and conscientious soldier. 
Though initially expressing a preference for serving in the Royal Canadian Artillery or the automotive trade, he adapted well to his role in the infantry, proving himself as a hard worker and effective soldier.

His service took him from Canada to the United Kingdom in June 1944, where he prepared for deployment to Italy. 
Arriving in Italy on July 17, 1944, Arthur joined the grueling Italian Campaign as part of the Allied effort to liberate the country from Axis forces. Despite the challenges of combat, he remained steadfast, displaying the resilience and dedication that defined him.

On December 20, 1944, during fierce fighting near the Fosso Munio, Arthur was killed in action. He was 28 years old. His death came as a profound loss to his family, who had eagerly awaited his return, and to his comrades, who valued his hard work and quiet leadership.

Private Arthur James Diwell was laid to rest in Villanova War Cemetery in Italy, Plot IV, Row B, Grave 7. His grave stands as a lasting tribute to his service and sacrifice.

Arthur’s life was one of commitment—to his family, his community, and his country. From his early days in Owen Sound to his final moments on the battlefield, he exemplified the qualities of his generation: resilience, hard work, and an unwavering sense of duty. His memory lives on in the hearts of his family and the history of the Perth Regiment, a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made in the pursuit of freedom and peace.
