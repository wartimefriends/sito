Letter written to Pte William Alexander Malloy by Benjamin Bleakley, a young Canadian student visiting the Cemetery with his Hockey Team on April 17, 2009

Dear Sir:
I am writing this letter because of your bravery and sacrifice fighting for your country in
Europe theater of war. Two summers with the 2nd Battalion Pictou Highlanders, before
Enlisting. 4 months basic training in Canada before being shipped overseas to Briton.
One year in Britain, assigned to the Irish Regimen and sent to Italy in October 1943. In
your short time in Italy you faced hardships that no one else has had to, or should face.
From frostbite to trench foot, rain, snow and heat you continued to fight for your country.
You crossed countless amounts of rivers and German blockades without the slightest
Hesitation. After you were injured in 1944 you returned to duty and continued to fight
right until the end. Your sacrifice made it possible to defeat Nazi Germany and Hitler
and make the world a safer place for me and those to come. To be able to get past as
many defense lines as you did that were created by Kesserling is an amazing feat
especially in such harsh weather and thick heavy mud. You are a real role
model for the soldiers of and an excellent example of how tough and courageous
a Canadian can be. Thank you for fighting to make the world a safer place. I am proud
to be a Canadian alongside you and feel that you are a true hero.
Sincerely,
Benjamin Bleakley
